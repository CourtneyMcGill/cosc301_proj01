C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on.

D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.

C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?

D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated.

D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30.

D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?

So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Judo you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Just in general how do I feel?
C: Yeah just in general, like can you describe it?
D: I think a lot of people think it’s a bad thing and in some cases it is because like it kind of ruins other relationships from forming, but that’s also the drinking culture that plays a huge part in that…but I like it. We didn’t have hookups in my high school so it was really new for me freshman year but at this point I enjoy it. I enjoy the random hookups. Some people regret them but I don’t, I prefer them.
C: So you think that’s what the hookup culture around here is mostly?
D: Yeah every once in a while you get consistent hookups but it still ends up being, in my experience, getting drunk and ending up in the same guy’s room.
C: So you think the drinking culture and hookup culture are related?
D: Yeah, I think one is the reason for the other, and they just feed into each other.
C: And which one do you think is the-
D: The drinking culture makes the hookup culture the way it is…but I also think a lot of people drink for the reasons of getting someone to hookup with so in a way they both just sort of work together.
C: And so you said you enjoy the hookup culture, do you also enjoy the drinking culture?
D: Yes.
C: Do you think that Colgate’s organized, sexuality based initiatives have had any affect on the sexual climate at Colgate?
D: Um, I don’t think in the larger picture it’s affected anything. Like going out its still the same thing, but personally I think I’ve embraced it more. Like I went to “This is not a Play About Sex” and like I thought that was really awesome and like that’s why I’m much more into the hookup culture now cause it wasn’t really bashing the culture on campus, it was just kind of saying, this is how it is and like I really liked that perspective on it. As for like bystander intervention, I haven’t been a part of it. Uh what’s the other one? Where you sit around in a group, or you get into groups. What is it? It was like every Tuesday night like ******** was a part of it? Fuck what was it? I don’t know, but it’s just where people voluntarily sign up to talk about their sex life in like small discussion groups. I’ll figure out the name to it. That apparently was very good and helpful. I haven’t been a part of it, but I think a lot of individuals say the initiatives are really good on campus, but I’m not sure how much of an effect it has collectively.
C: Okay.
D: Yeah, sorry.
C: No, that was good.
C: Does Colgate’s general culture promote an idea of sexuality that’s different than how you grew up, I know you mentioned there weren’t hookups in high school.
D: Yeah, absolutely. People only hooked up with someone they were dating, for a while, whether that’s like oral sex or sex sex. So coming here I was like ashamed for having drunk hookups like when I was hooking up with two guys in two nights or two guys in two months like I kind of looked down on it, I was like oh that’s gross and slutty, but it’s definitely changed being on this campus has definitely changed my perception of it. Like its not necessarily something I’m proud of but its not something I’m ashamed of anymore either.
C: And do you think that’s Colgate specific or do you think that’s how a lot of transitions are from high school to college in general?
D: Yeah I think that’s just a transition in general. Like high school is just awkward and weird anyway and like college is still awkward and weird and like I bet you its gonna be a weird transition leaving college and going into the real world too but I don’t want to think about that right now.
C: So you think it’s just kind of college not specifically Colgate?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: Do you think it differs at all from like a small school to a big school?
D: I don’t really know. Most of my friends go to small schools like Colgate so I can’t really compare. I’d imagine it’s a lot less weird because you don’t run into the hookup that you had last night like five times on campus the next day because that happens to me literally every time. So, there’s that difference, but, I think some bigger schools would push even more of a hookup culture because it’s such a random and anonymous thing like you wont see them the next day.
C: Can you describe the social scene at Colgate?
D: Like the drinking scene?
C: Just in general the social scene.
D: My experience has just been going out. (laughs). I mean I have friends that I go out with and I guess I made them in sober contexts, but most of the people I meet now I meet out in a bar or a fraternity, um, so that’s the extent of my social experience. It’s fun, I have a lot of fun drinking, but it inhibits any social interactions when you’re sober. I don’t think people really know how to communicate when they’re sober, um, and people think it’s weird when you hang out with your friends, your guy friends, or your friends of the opposite sex if you’re sober. They think that means that your into them or that you’re dating or something weird and I hate that more than anything.
C: So you think the social scene is mainly focused around drinking?
D: Yes.
C: And are there different- Does everyone participate in the drinking scene or are there certain-
D: I think the Greek community is probably the biggest. I know that there are some people that don’t drink at all on campus and some people that do drink just as much as anyone in a frat or a sorority, but a lot of the people who do go out to drink end up at a frat. Some people do just go straight to bars, but, yeah it think the biggest group on campus would be the Greek life people.
C: And do you think athletics fit into the social scene at all, being a division one school?
D: Not in my experience. I know a lot of people go to  (varsity male sport) parties after a big win or to the (different varsity male sport) frat after a big win for (that varsity male sport). But personally it hasn’t really affected anything, like tailgating isn’t really a big thing. It’s weird cause we have D 1 athletics but a lot of people just don’t give a shit about it. (laughs)
C: Do you think your social experience at Colgate would be different if you were a different race or ethnicity?
D: Yes.
C: How do you think it would be different?
D: I guess I wouldn’t really know until I was put in their shoes, but there’s a huge stigma surrounded by international students and that um without even considering international students, just people of different colors or ethnicities, um, for the most part. That’s a huge generalization and its not true in all aspects but like I think that they have formed different social groups, whether by choice or just by the white majority of people excluding them from social events… which sounds awful.
C: So you’re talking about minorities and international students?
D: Yeah.
C: Okay, and do you think that they, do you see them mixing together or are those groups kept separate?
D: I think those are pretty separate. The international students are very close because they are dealing with um, I mean I’m sure they can relate with each other the best, better than anyone else can, but yeah they’re very separate from other ethnicities on campus.
C: So what do you think their social experience is like?
D: No idea. Sounds really bad, but I’m not really aware of what they do socially. I’m sure some of them go out and drink and maybe I just don’t see it, wow I’m awful, but I think a lot of them, at least from the few that I’ve met, they, um, stay in on the weekends for the most part. They hang out with friends but they don’t go downtown.
C: And what would you say the minority students’ social scene is like?
D: Uh, this is another generalization, but I think they’re a little more comfortable going downtown and to frats cause I guess like they’re used to the American party culture, whereas international students aren’t necessarily used to that, but I still think they’re pretty ostracized from like the typical Colgate: frat, Jug, Bacon, Slices night. I don’t know, maybe I don’t see them as much when I’m out either, but I just don’t notice them when out much.
C: And do you think race ethnicity has an effect on the hookup culture at all?
D: I think so. Not in the sense that I think people are racist and won’t hookup with other people of different ethnicities, at least personally I’m not. But I think it’s because socially they’re more isolate, like the hookup culture is the social culture. So because that group is isolated from the general population at Colgate, there’s not really a chance for those groups to hookup across racial lines.
C: And do you think gender has an effect on the social experience at Colgate?
D: Yeah, a lot. In a lot of ways.
C: Can you give some examples?
D: Well I mean first of all there’s six fraternities on campus um and only three sororities. And like I said, Greek life is a huge part of the social life. That is just obvious that there’s a lot more opportunities for guys to get involved than for girls and fraternities are allowed to host things while sororities aren’t, like host social events while sororities aren’t. That’s another huge thing, like we’re only allowed to be guests at social events, and guys have the control of basically any party that they want to throw.
D: Do you want to put in that I’m a social chair of a sorority?
C:  Yeah, you can say that. You can say whatever you want on here.
D: Yeah so like I didn’t realize, um, how true that is, but like you’d think that like as a social chair that I’d have like a lot of control over what our sorority does socially, but like I don’t really. I like give them dates that are open, and they take them or they cancel on us or they change the theme, change the place, change the date or time, um, so like, I’m not that much of a feminist, but like in that sense, it really pisses me off that girls don’t have more of a say, because when it comes to social life, like without girls guys wouldn’t have any fun when they’re out but like we don’t get to have any influence on like what we’re doing when we’re out, we just have to go to the frats cause that’s just basically all we have.
C: And do you think that gender has an influence on the hookup culture?
D: Yeah. Not, like, I said that Colgate girls and guys, I guess everyone, can like own up to their sexuality, hookup is fine and celebrated. But I’ve seen some things that guys do when they’re out, like hooking up with three different girls within an hour, and then that happens to a girl and that’s just, they get shat on for doing something like that. Guys get to like fist-bump their fraternity brothers and girls are like oh you’re a sloppy slut like you need to go home and like regret your actions. Um, and yeah maybe they probably shouldn’t have done that, but its just a very big double standard that if girls are very aggressive about their sexuality then its like considered slutty, but if guys are then its considered being a bro.
C: And do you find that more prominent or specific to Colgate or just college in general?
D: Colgate’s my main experience with like a hookup culture like this, but like I think its pretty fair to say that’s something in general.
C: And do you think that goes on outside of the drinking culture, or do you think that double is held when alcohol is not involved?
D: No, I think its held when alcohols not involved. Like I said, I don’t have much experience with sober hookup cultures, but I think its just a thing in societies where your drinking or not.
C: And, now just changing a little bit. Growing up, how did your family or friends influence your identity?
D: Oooh such a deep question. Um. I had three older sisters, so ill start with the family, so I clearly had three obvious role models, well role models in the sense that they were the three people that I looked up to most directly. Not necessarily that they were the best people to look up to, but I think that’s how they affected my identity in a way. Like they fucked up a lot, and got in trouble a lot, and like I was the younger sister listening to them get grounded or like get in trouble with my parents so like I saw that happen, so I think that made me a little but more rebellious, and I think it also made my parents much more lenient by the time I got to high school and had to deal with things like that. And when I say fucked up I mean like drinking and drugs and whatever and stuff like that. So I think that was a huge part of me going into high school and college cause like I had seen it happen and I was just like oh my sisters turned out fine so I was much more open and exposed to drinking and hooking up than my friends who didn’t have three older sisters were. And then when it came to friends, they kind of had the opposite affect on me. Like they were, to put it bluntly, kind of prude in high school. Like when I told them I lost my virginity they were like what the heck you’ve only been dating this guy for like six months and I was like EXACTLY, SIX fucking months like. I mean granted I was like two years younger than him but like, I don’t know, we were dating and like I was completely fine with it, but like they were just so shocked and appalled by it that it was just like what the heck I don’t know. So I got conflicting views from my friends and my family I think. My parents didn’t really play a part in it. I don’t fucking talk to my parents about this shit and I never fucking will. They agree, like I think that they know that I’m like mature enough to make my decisions so they respect my uh uh personal space when it comes to that.
C: So you don’t talk to your parents about sex at all?
D: Um, they know that I’m on birth control, now I’m not on birth control. So I talk to them about that. And they know that I’ve had sex and they know more- or they assume more than one person
C: How do they know that you’ve had sex?
D: It’s like an unspoken thing. I was dating this guys for like a year and a half, it was a pretty serious. And they liked him and like and like I went and visited him at college when he was in college and I was in high school. Like they aren’t naïve like they went through this with four girls so like they assumed it. They probably don’t know that like I have sex here more than like, with more than like, like with someone who’s less than my boyfriend. They probably still think that I’m just having sex with someone who means more to me than a random hookup. But they definitely know that I’ve done it. I’m trying to think of what else. This is funny… I was telling my parents about the whole rape situation on campus and how its hard sometimes to figure out if its rape or not cause people just get really really drunk and my dad just flat out asked me do you have drunk sex and I flat out told him like I’m not having this conversation with you and my mom just looked at him like he was crazy so I think he is a little more comfortable at this point talking about things like that, but like we still don’t really, like I also have my friends and my sisters to talk about things like that so I don’t feel like I need to talk to my mom about things like that sex related, God.
C: So your friends and sisters kind of filled that?
D: Yeah, mhm.
C: So are your parents married and living together?
D: Yes, yes.
C: And can you talk a little bit about their marriage 
D: Its really fucking boring. I don’t know. They like, is say boring but I guess that means stable. And like they always say that, like I say how boring their lives are and they like all their kids are gone and they can do whatever they want but they’re always like boring is good, boring means no trouble. But its stupid and I hope I don’t end up like that. Like they’re happily married and like love each other still, but like boring GOD so boring. I mean like their version of an exciting night is like going to the movies with another couple who’s kids have graduated and then like getting a beer. And like maybe that’s what I’ll want when I’m 55 and 56 but I cannot imagine that being what I ever want. And like God I love them but like no not for me.
C: So how long have they been together, or married?
D: They started dating in college. They dated for seven years before they got engaged and I think they’ve been married now for thirty years.
C: So how much older are your sisters?
D: The oldest is 6 years older than me, and then its 4 and then its like a year and a half. So 25, 23, and 21. Yeah, we’re all within 6 years.
C: So they were married when they had all of the kids?
D: Yeah.
C: And now can you talk a little bit more about your relationship experiences? You mentioned you had a boyfriend in high school who was two years older. So how old were you?
D: Um. We started dating-
C: You can make up a name for him too
D: Okay, I started dating Nathan. We were best friends my sophomore year in high school, his senior year. And then we didn’t hook up or start dating or anything until the summer of my going into senior year and his sophomore. No, the summer of me going into my senior year and his sophomore year yeah no that’s right. So we were friends like a long time in high school and then he went away and that was fine and like I wasn’t into it, and this is gonna be such a long story but um. But, he was like really into it when we were  just friends and then clearly when he goes away I like realized oh look I liked him, can’t, whatever. So then we like started dating over the summer and like decided to stay dating when like he went away to college. Like just keep talking about it?
C: Yeah, just however much-
D: I would visit him and he would come home for the breaks and like I didn’t mind the long distance thing cause there was just literally no one else I was interested in my high school in at all so like that was nice.
C: And where did he go to school?
D: Bowdoin. So it was like eight hours for me to visit him, but like I did it like three times his first, the first year that we were dating.
C: And when did you guys breakup?
D: We broke up the spring of my senior year in high school, so I guess we weren’t even dating for a full year. But like, we had been friends for like three years, but like, interesting, I never thought about that. But like yeah we broke up the spring my senior year in high school and it was funny cause like when we got together I was like oh I don’t know why we’re dating, like you’re in college, you should experience college and like not have a girlfriend in high school, like how lame is that. But he wanted to date me and I was like fine I have nothing else to do. And that sounds like very callous of me but that happened. And then by the time I decided where I was going to college and was getting ready to go away, I was like not into having a boyfriend so we broke up when I was still in high school and like still hooked up over the summer but like knew we weren’t staying together.
C: So that was your only boyfriend in high school?
D: Yeah.
C: And have you dated at all here?
D: Nope.
C: Do you think there are a lot of dating couples on campus?
D: No, its, you see a few juniors or seniors dating people but that’s like a rare thing to see I think
C: So how would you define like the term committed relationship?
D: At Colgate?
C: Just in general.
D: Well in general, exclusive so you don’t hookup with other people, you’re seeing them everyday if your like in close like if its not a long distance relationship but like you’re talking to them everyday if it is, what else… you hang out with them a lot. But at Colgate committed relationship kind of equals like for some people, just not hooking up with other people but just hooking up with each other when you’re out. And that’s not like a committed relationship and like some people do soberly hang out and like go on dates and that’s fine but yeah. (laughs). I’m sorry.
C: Have you had a committed relationship even if it wasn’t like dating or anything here?
D: No.
C: So the last thing you would define as a committed relationship would be in-
D: in high school, yes
C: So what are your beliefs toward marriage and how important is that to you?
D: Um, its marriage. I’m not like against marriage and I know I’ll probably end up married but like right now its really hard to imagine someone being like yeah why not let me just say I’ll spend the rest of my life with you, like I don’t understand why you need to say that if you want to. But then I do get that there’s like legal issues like custody over children and property and money blah-blah-blah so like I get marriage in that sense but its just like if you’re gonna be with them forever why don’t you just be with them forever? I don’t know.
C: So just like living with them and stuff like that?
D: Yeah and like in my experience making things official and putting labels on things just scares me off and like its really dumb but it makes it much more serious and more intense and its much more intimidating, so I guess that’s the best word to describe my stance right now, is that I’m intimidated by it but like I’m also not someone who’s gonna say like oh I’m never gonna get married because I know like I probably will and I’m sure I’ll be happy but it just seems very far off and like not very relevant to my life right now.
C: So its not something that you’re like directly thinking about right now?
D: No, not at all.
C: What do you think your parents hopes or opinions are surrounding your future relationships or marriage are?
D: The day I moved into Colgate, my dad turned to me cause like my parents loved the guy I dated, Nathan, they loved Nathan. He was like literally any parents dream come true, like really polite, nice, smart, got into Bowdoin and was running cross-country there, really independent, responsible basically a safe guy… even though he clearly wasn’t like he got me into drinking, drugs, sex like he basically like any bad influence he could have on me he did… but he held up that façade for my parents which was great, but back to the story. So my dad turned to me when he moved me into Colgate and he goes, I think that you should marry Nathan and I was just like WHAT THE FUCK what are you talking about? I think he got really intimidated and realized that I was going away for four years with out their supervision to a party school and like now constantly asking me and all my sisters like why don’t you have a boyfriend, when are you gonna get married? Kind of as a joke but also like slightly concerned that he has four daughters and none of them are even close to being near in a relationship let alone engaged or married. So I think that’s like their next step for them like oh our kids our in college, next they’ll be married and like moving into a house, so I think like they’re ready for that cause like my oldest sisters like 25 so that’s fine, so like her step is there, but like they’re kind of skipping over my step as like being a 19 year old in college and like shoving me in with my sisters. So like yeah there are expectations for that but like that’s just not even relevant to me right now.
C: So like they want you to get married and stuff but you aren’t too concerned about the fact that they want you to get married at this point.
D: Yeah and like when I tell them that’s not something I’m thinking about at this point they’re like oh yeah that’s true like you’re 19 and you’re in college but then other times they’re like oh we just want you to be happy and we don’t want you to be alone- like they equate the two and I’m like, I’d be perfectly, like I like my alone time (laughs). Like I think I would be perfectly fine not getting married. But yeah they want me to get married and have kids.
C: So can you describe your relationship with your parents a little bit? Are you like close with them?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: You said you had sisters you talked about.
D: Yeah, yeah, as much as I can remember like before I went to college like we just like fought all the time or like weren’t that close. Like in middle school or early high school my parents were more concerned with like my older sisters because like they were the ones that like fighting with them and causing problems and then I was home alone my junior and senior year cause all of my sisters were out of the house so I got more attention from them and I think we got closer because I was like the last kid but they also like started fighting with me more. So like we had a stronger relationship, but like that might not necessarily mean we had a better one because we were fighting so much. But now that I’m in college I think that like I’ve matured a lot, like its not that, it wasn’t my parents fault at all, I was being a little whiney bitch in high school and that’s the reason we fought. But now when I come home I feel a lot closer and I feel a lot more comfortable talking to them about drinking and drugs and like they know that I smoke pot sometimes and like they know that I drink all the time, um, I don’t explicitly talk about hooking up with them, but they know it happens, so I think being away and like having my own independence without having to fight against them at home has made us closer if anything. And like the same goes for my sisters, like they went through the same rebellious thing in high school but now they’re much more mature and nicer to my parents as well now that they’re away from them.
C: And, just kind of going back when we were talking a little bit ago about marriage. When you think about relationships in college, do you ever think that a college relationship could lead to marriage.
D: Like I said it doesn’t seem very relevant to my life right now so I don’t think about it that much, but like I do see seniors who are graduating right now and my question is always like oh are you gonna stay together cause like that seems valid like why just break up if you’re really into this person and I realize that I’m asking like oh are you gonna stay together and then like the next question is like what next, like what is in plan for your future?
C: Like if you stay together, what comes next?
D: Yeah, if you stay together then like that means like you see a future beyond college, which means like dating in the real world, getting engaged, and getting married. Like there’s nothing really else that like why else would you stay with them. And like what’s the statistic at Colgate like 30% of people meet their spouse here? I don’t know. So I guess it’s in the back of my mind, but its still really weird for me to think about.
C: So you think, you’ve been talking mostly about juniors and seniors, do you think that’s when most of the like dating and relationships happen?
D: Yeah, I don’t get the point of dating anyone your first year like why? I don’t know. Like for me I guess, I don’t know, that was my time to like do whatever the fuck I wanted and like I feel like if I had dated anyone my freshman year I would regret it now just cause like I was all over the place and like I had fun being on my own freshman year, and sophomore year its like oh a consistent hookup would be nice but like never dating like I wouldn’t have time like I LITERALLY wouldn’t have time for that and like I can’t like going on dates and hanging out and stuff is one thing but like its also like constantly texting someone and like that’s a lot of time and like constantly thinking about someone that also takes a lot of time, it actually does. So like freshman and sophomore year- ehh. But like junior and senior year I can see the appeal cause like you’ve been on campus for four years and like what else are you gonna do unless like you want to keep hooking up, which is fine, like that might happen to me but, um, but yeah to answer your question yeah I think it’s mainly juniors and seniors that are dating.
C: And do you think that’s across all, like men prefer that more or women prefer that more?
D: To stereo-type, I think women would date anyone at any point in their college career, I would say like some of my friends are completely against that and like prove that stereotype wrong, but like I think yeah females are much more open to dating at any point where guys are just like you can’t tie me down.
C: And do you think women thing about marriage at all here?
D: Ahh, I hope not. (laughs) but yeah I think that they do, not in like the crazy, like I don’t want to make them all out to seem like super crazy and like oh I just have to find a husband but I think that like girls here are much more realistic about dating and like what that relationship is where as guys just like cant think further than two weeks.
C: So can you also speak more on your ideas on sexual experience. On a first date, like an actual date,  what do you feel is the most appropriate level of physical contact?
D: I guess it depends on the guy, which like sounds really bad, but like if you’re into it lets, see. So this is like a date? Like you go out to dinner?
C: Yeah. 
D: Hm.
C: Okay well first of all do you think dating happens very often on Colgate’s campus?
D: No, no!
C: So do you think this question is irrelevant or do you think that every once in a while?
D: I mean, its kind of irrelevant but I’ll answer it anyway. I mean some people do go to dinner and watch a movie, rarely, but like, I guess the best description of a date that like I’ve seen happen like A FEW times on Colgate’s campus is like a guy coming over and like watching a movie in bed with a girl. Like that’s a date here. (laughs). So like in that sense?
C: Yeah, in that sense, we’ll do that.
D: So then like you go back to a dorm and you’re laying in bed like watching a movie and like you’re clearly going to hookup at the end of the movie or during the movie, um, so like make out obviously.
C: Is this sober or drunk?
D: Um, if it’s a date I would say sober, so like making out great that’s fine. Like I wouldn’t say have sex at all on a first date, no. Like oral sex? I would say I’m into it so like I would do it if I felt comfortable so like again that’s like is the guy nice? The main like I always draw for like going down on a guy is like um, like if its obvious that that’s all he’s interested in, like for some reason I just have this weird thought in my mind that like that’s all he wants then I’m not gonna give it to him, like I’m very stubborn in that sense, but like if its clear that that’s not all he wants then like ah yeah here’s your reward.
C: What do you mean by that’s all he wants?
D: Like if he like literally just wants to get head and get out of there cause like, I wouldn’t, like its pretty obvious when like that’s all that guys are interested in.
C: So does that go for drunk hookups too or just sober?
D: Well drunk hookups its harder to tall cause you’re drunk but like and I’m much more willing to give oral sex when I’m drunk so I don’t draw the line as much there , but like I still, basically if he’s a douche I’m not gonna to give it to him and if he’s not then I will. And like I kind of tell if he’s a douche or not based on the way he’s acting, like if he’s pushing it too much I get pissed off and like I don’t want to give him a blowjob like I just don’t want to because I’m stubborn and I like saying that its my call to make because it is, I think and whatever. So when he tries taking that decision away from me like I get really mad.
C: What do you mean taking the decision away from you?
D: Like when he says like oh but you have to or and I’m just like what no I don’t HAVE To what are you talking about (laughs) like you cant make me, so like yeah that’s just like how I decide, like how he’s acting and like how important it is to him and just if he’s nice to me or not
C: And you think guys are comfortable saying that?
D: What like saying you have to?
C: Yeah saying that or even just like asking.
D: Yeah, they’re completely comfortable. At least in my experience, and I know some people are like oh he didn’t even make a move so maybe I just pick really aggressive guys or maybe like I act very aggressively about it so they assume that I will. But I have had so many experiences where they are like come on you can’t just leave me like this, and I’m like I can, I wont feel guilty about it or like please, like sometimes when they ask its nicer, but also I’ve also just had people be like this is stupid, you should, and I’m just like no, I shouldn’t like leave me alone.
C: So you think there is like an expectation that guys have about it?
D: Yeah, like in my experience most, like its been a pleasant surprise when guys haven’t been expecting it, but I know that like I’ve talked to a lot of my friends that are like no he didn’t expect it at all, or like he didn’t make any moves towards it at all, so I don’t know if it’s just the way, am I a very aggressive kisser and like body gestures make it seem like I’m about to give him head, I don’t know.
C: And do you think that s a male specific thing, or do you think you, or your friends, or other women are just as likely to be aggressive about receiving oral sex as much as men are?
D: No, like I’ve never ever, like, been like oh you have to. Like I like oral sex, I do, but I’ve never been like you have to go down on me or like you can’t leave me like this, mostly because like they usually just finger me instead and I prefer that much more because its more pleasurable for me.
C: So like that’s a you thing?
D: Yeah and like I don’t think I’ve ever like wanted to be fingered or like eaten out and its not happened, so I don’t know if like I’d have to ask, but I would imagine if I were in a situation where I was giving him head and I wanted something I would be like yo.
C: So you would feel comfortable saying that?
D: Yeah.
C: And do you think most girls would feel comfortable saying that?
D: I guess it depends on how much they hookup. I mean I don’t think I would have been comfortable freshman year here but at this point I’ve hooked up enough and I don’t think guys would think its weird for me to ask them to do something because its like if they’re asking me, I might as well get something out of it too.
C: So do you think that you mentioned before, that men have an expectation that when they go home with someone that they’ll be receiving oral sex. Do you think that women have the same expectation?
D: No, like at least when I go home with someone I rarely am thinking like what I’m gonna get out of it and more like how far he’s gonna push it, cause it is always up to me like where I draw the line, so that’s always the thought process that goes through my mind so yeah no I never really have an expectation for it, I’m just always wondering what his expectations are for it.
C: And do you think that men think if they’re receiving oral sex that they should be giving it, or do you think that’s just not something that crosses their minds?
D: I think most, well not necessarily oral, but like I’ve never had a situation where like I gave someone head and they didn’t like finger me or like eat me out in return.
C: Would you say that’s a typical experience at Colgate?
D: I don’t know. I don’t know. I think for me its typical and its even like and say I’m on my period or like I don’t want it for whatever reason, they ask why not so like they want to kind of like do it, which I wouldn’t expect from a lot of the guys. But like as far as other people at Colgate, I guess I wouldn’t know. A lot of my friends like don’t talk about that or don’t like share those stories.
C: Talk about what?
D: Like if they come home from like hooking up with a guy, wither they don’t go that far because like they don’t feel comfortable going that far or like they feel weird being like, oh he ate me out or like oh I gave him a blowjob.
C: So do you think there’s a difference between being comfortable with saying oh he hate me out or oh I gave him a blowjob? Or do you think people would be equally open about those?
D: Um, I think people are more embarrassed to say oh he ate me out. Yeah cause like in my experience girls are like (squealing voice) eww he did it.. where as they’re just like oh yeah I gave him a blowjob. And like even me I’m just like, well first of all it’s a fucking weird ass phrase to say. Like EW.
C: It is a weird term.
D: Like I don’t think I’m that much of a prude but like that just freaks me out a little bit, but yeah I think there’s definitely a difference when you say it to someone between those two like giving and getting. People are more embarrassed to say that they got it.
C: And do you think that’s men too, like men are more embarrassed to say that they received too?
D: Oh, no
C: Oh, you think it’s gender specific?
D: Oh, yeah, (laughs), absolutely.
C: And do you think that expectations and stuff for oral sex depend on if people are dating or if its just a hookup?
D: Um, yeah, I guess so, so like two people that haven’t done oral sex at all yet like if they’re dating or not? Cause I guess like if they’re dating I’d assume that they already have, but you’re saying in this case that they already have and they’re dating?
C: Just like in general, like not necessarily how the relationship developed but just like two people. Like do you think that if they’re dating do you think that they’re likely to be giving and receiving oral sex like at the same levels?
D: I think they’re more likely because they’re probably more comfortable with each other
C: Do you think there’s a difference in like expectations that a man would have a woman and that a woman would have of a man?
D: Oh in a relationship?
C: Yeah.
D: In my experience, like when I dated Nathan, it was equal, but like he was also a very respectable guy, so like that may have mad a difference, but like if he expected something I expected it back. I don’t know, I think that when you’re dating each other, you both know or should know what each other want so there should be no difference in expectations or asking for it if you want it. But I know that’s not always the case, and in some cases, well most cases girls get embarrassed about it.
C: In relationships or hookups?
D: Relationships.
C: And do you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations. st in general how do I feel?
C: Yeah just in general, like can you describe it?
D: I think a lot of people think it’s a bad thing and in some cases it is because like it kind of ruins other relationships from forming, but that’s also the drinking culture that plays a huge part in that…but I like it. We didn’t have hookups in my high school so it was really new for me freshman year but at this point I enjoy it. I enjoy the random hookups. Some people regret them but I don’t, I prefer them.
C: So you think that’s what the hookup culture around here is mostly?
D: Yeah every once in a while you get consistent hookups but it still ends up being, in my experience, getting drunk and ending up in the same guy’s room.
C: So you think the drinking culture and hookup culture are related?
D: Yeah, I think one is the reason for the other, and they just feed into each other.
C: And which one do you think is the-
D: The drinking culture makes the hookup culture the way it is…but I also think a lot of people drink for the reasons of getting someone to hookup with so in a way they both just sort of work together.
C: And so you said you enjoy the hookup culture, do you also enjoy the drinking culture?
D: Yes.
C: Do you think that Colgate’s organized, sexuality based initiatives have had any affect on the sexual climate at Colgate?
D: Um, I don’t think in the larger picture it’s affected anything. Like going out its still the same thing, but personally I think I’ve embraced it more. Like I went to “This is not a Play About Sex” and like I thought that was really awesome and like that’s why I’m much more into the hookup culture now cause it wasn’t really bashing the culture on campus, it was just kind of saying, this is how it is and like I really liked that perspective on it. As for like bystander intervention, I haven’t been a part of it. Uh what’s the other one? Where you sit around in a group, or you get into groups. What is it? It was like every Tuesday night like ******** was a part of it? Fuck what was it? I don’t know, but it’s just where people voluntarily sign up to talk about their sex life in like small discussion groups. I’ll figure out the name to it. That apparently was very good and helpful. I haven’t been a part of it, but I think a lot of individuals say the initiatives are really good on campus, but I’m not sure how much of an effect it has collectively.
C: Okay.
D: Yeah, sorry.
C: No, that was good.
C: Does Colgate’s general culture promote an idea of sexuality that’s different than how you grew up, I know you mentioned there weren’t hookups in high school.
D: Yeah, absolutely. People only hooked up with someone they were dating, for a while, whether that’s like oral sex or sex sex. So coming here I was like ashamed for having drunk hookups like when I was hooking up with two guys in two nights or two guys in two months like I kind of looked down on it, I was like oh that’s gross and slutty, but it’s definitely changed being on this campus has definitely changed my perception of it. Like its not necessarily something I’m proud of but its not something I’m ashamed of anymore either.
C: And do you think that’s Colgate specific or do you think that’s how a lot of transitions are from high school to college in general?
D: Yeah I think that’s just a transition in general. Like high school is just awkward and weird anyway and like college is still awkward and weird and like I bet you its gonna be a weird transition leaving college and going into the real world too but I don’t want to think about that right now.
C: So you think it’s just kind of college not specifically Colgate?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: Do you think it differs at all from like a small school to a big school?
D: I don’t really know. Most of my friends go to small schools like Colgate so I can’t really compare. I’d imagine it’s a lot less weird because you don’t run into the hookup that you had last night like five times on campus the next day because that happens to me literally every time. So, there’s that difference, but, I think some bigger schools would push even more of a hookup culture because it’s such a random and anonymous thing like you wont see them the next day.
C: Can you describe the social scene at Colgate?
D: Like the drinking scene?
C: Just in general the social scene.
D: My experience has just been going out. (laughs). I mean I have friends that I go out with and I guess I made them in sober contexts, but most of the people I meet now I meet out in a bar or a fraternity, um, so that’s the extent of my social experience. It’s fun, I have a lot of fun drinking, but it inhibits any social interactions when you’re sober. I don’t think people really know how to communicate when they’re sober, um, and people think it’s weird when you hang out with your friends, your guy friends, or your friends of the opposite sex if you’re sober. They think that means that your into them or that you’re dating or something weird and I hate that more than anything.
C: So you think the social scene is mainly focused around drinking?
D: Yes.
C: And are there different- Does everyone participate in the drinking scene or are there certain-
D: I think the Greek community is probably the biggest. I know that there are some people that don’t drink at all on campus and some people that do drink just as much as anyone in a frat or a sorority, but a lot of the people who do go out to drink end up at a frat. Some people do just go straight to bars, but, yeah it think the biggest group on campus would be the Greek life people.
C: And do you think athletics fit into the social scene at all, being a division one school?
D: Not in my experience. I know a lot of people go to  (varsity male sport) parties after a big win or to the (different varsity male sport) frat after a big win for (that varsity male sport). But personally it hasn’t really affected anything, like tailgating isn’t really a big thing. It’s weird cause we have D 1 athletics but a lot of people just don’t give a shit about it. (laughs)
C: Do you think your social experience at Colgate would be different if you were a different race or ethnicity?
D: Yes.
C: How do you think it would be different?
D: I guess I wouldn’t really know until I was put in their shoes, but there’s a huge stigma surrounded by international students and that um without even considering international students, just people of different colors or ethnicities, um, for the most part. That’s a huge generalization and its not true in all aspects but like I think that they have formed different social groups, whether by choice or just by the white majority of people excluding them from social events… which sounds awful.
C: So you’re talking about minorities and international students?
D: Yeah.
C: Okay, and do you think that they, do you see them mixing together or are those groups kept separate?
D: I think those are pretty separate. The international students are very close because they are dealing with um, I mean I’m sure they can relate with each other the best, better than anyone else can, but yeah they’re very separate from other ethnicities on campus.
C: So what do you think their social experience is like?
D: No idea. Sounds really bad, but I’m not really aware of what they do socially. I’m sure some of them go out and drink and maybe I just don’t see it, wow I’m awful, but I think a lot of them, at least from the few that I’ve met, they, um, stay in on the weekends for the most part. They hang out with friends but they don’t go downtown.
C: And what would you say the minority students’ social scene is like?
D: Uh, this is another generalization, but I think they’re a little more comfortable going downtown and to frats cause I guess like they’re used to the American party culture, whereas international students aren’t necessarily used to that, but I still think they’re pretty ostracized from like the typical Colgate: frat, Jug, Bacon, Slices night. I don’t know, maybe I don’t see them as much when I’m out either, but I just don’t notice them when out much.
C: And do you think race ethnicity has an effect on the hookup culture at all?
D: I think so. Not in the sense that I think people are racist and won’t hookup with other people of different ethnicities, at least personally I’m not. But I think it’s because socially they’re more isolate, like the hookup culture is the social culture. So because that group is isolated from the general population at Colgate, there’s not really a chance for those groups to hookup across racial lines.
C: And do you think gender has an effect on the social experience at Colgate?
D: Yeah, a lot. In a lot of ways.
C: Can you give some examples?
D: Well I mean first of all there’s six fraternities on campus um and only three sororities. And like I said, Greek life is a huge part of the social life. That is just obvious that there’s a lot more opportunities for guys to get involved than for girls and fraternities are allowed to host things while sororities aren’t, like host social events while sororities aren’t. That’s another huge thing, like we’re only allowed to be guests at social events, and guys have the control of basically any party that they want to throw.
D: Do you want to put in that I’m a social chair of a sorority?
C:  Yeah, you can say that. You can say whatever you want on here.
D: Yeah so like I didn’t realize, um, how true that is, but like you’d think that like as a social chair that I’d have like a lot of control over what our sorority does socially, but like I don’t really. I like give them dates that are open, and they take them or they cancel on us or they change the theme, change the place, change the date or time, um, so like, I’m not that much of a feminist, but like in that sense, it really pisses me off that girls don’t have more of a say, because when it comes to social life, like without girls guys wouldn’t have any fun when they’re out but like we don’t get to have any influence on like what we’re doing when we’re out, we just have to go to the frats cause that’s just basically all we have.
C: And do you think that gender has an influence on the hookup culture?
D: Yeah. Not, like, I said that Colgate girls and guys, I guess everyone, can like own up to their sexuality, hookup is fine and celebrated. But I’ve seen some things that guys do when they’re out, like hooking up with three different girls within an hour, and then that happens to a girl and that’s just, they get shat on for doing something like that. Guys get to like fist-bump their fraternity brothers and girls are like oh you’re a sloppy slut like you need to go home and like regret your actions. Um, and yeah maybe they probably shouldn’t have done that, but its just a very big double standard that if girls are very aggressive about their sexuality then its like considered slutty, but if guys are then its considered being a bro.
C: And do you find that more prominent or specific to Colgate or just college in general?
D: Colgate’s my main experience with like a hookup culture like this, but like I think its pretty fair to say that’s something in general.
C: And do you think that goes on outside of the drinking culture, or do you think that double is held when alcohol is not involved?
D: No, I think its held when alcohols not involved. Like I said, I don’t have much experience with sober hookup cultures, but I think its just a thing in societies where your drinking or not.
C: And, now just changing a little bit. Growing up, how did your family or friends influence your identity?
D: Oooh such a deep question. Um. I had three older sisters, so ill start with the family, so I clearly had three obvious role models, well role models in the sense that they were the three people that I looked up to most directly. Not necessarily that they were the best people to look up to, but I think that’s how they affected my identity in a way. Like they fucked up a lot, and got in trouble a lot, and like I was the younger sister listening to them get grounded or like get in trouble with my parents so like I saw that happen, so I think that made me a little but more rebellious, and I think it also made my parents much more lenient by the time I got to high school and had to deal with things like that. And when I say fucked up I mean like drinking and drugs and whatever and stuff like that. So I think that was a huge part of me going into high school and college cause like I had seen it happen and I was just like oh my sisters turned out fine so I was much more open and exposed to drinking and hooking up than my friends who didn’t have three older sisters were. And then when it came to friends, they kind of had the opposite affect on me. Like they were, to put it bluntly, kind of prude in high school. Like when I told them I lost my virginity they were like what the heck you’ve only been dating this guy for like six months and I was like EXACTLY, SIX fucking months like. I mean granted I was like two years younger than him but like, I don’t know, we were dating and like I was completely fine with it, but like they were just so shocked and appalled by it that it was just like what the heck I don’t know. So I got conflicting views from my friends and my family I think. My parents didn’t really play a part in it. I don’t fucking talk to my parents about this shit and I never fucking will. They agree, like I think that they know that I’m like mature enough to make my decisions so they respect my uh uh personal space when it comes to that.
C: So you don’t talk to your parents about sex at all?
D: Um, they know that I’m on birth control, now I’m not on birth control. So I talk to them about that. And they know that I’ve had sex and they know more- or they assume more than one person
C: How do they know that you’ve had sex?
D: It’s like an unspoken thing. I was dating this guys for like a year and a half, it was a pretty serious. And they liked him and like and like I went and visited him at college when he was in college and I was in high school. Like they aren’t naïve like they went through this with four girls so like they assumed it. They probably don’t know that like I have sex here more than like, with more than like, like with someone who’s less than my boyfriend. They probably still think that I’m just having sex with someone who means more to me than a random hookup. But they definitely know that I’ve done it. I’m trying to think of what else. This is funny… I was telling my parents about the whole rape situation on campus and how its hard sometimes to figure out if its rape or not cause people just get really really drunk and my dad just flat out asked me do you have drunk sex and I flat out told him like I’m not having this conversation with you and my mom just looked at him like he was crazy so I think he is a little more comfortable at this point talking about things like that, but like we still don’t really, like I also have my friends and my sisters to talk about things like that so I don’t feel like I need to talk to my mom about things like that sex related, God.
C: So your friends and sisters kind of filled that?
D: Yeah, mhm.
C: So are your parents married and living together?
D: Yes, yes.
C: And can you talk a little bit about their marriage 
D: Its really fucking boring. I don’t know. They like, is say boring but I guess that means stable. And like they always say that, like I say how boring their lives are and they like all their kids are gone and they can do whatever they want but they’re always like boring is good, boring means no trouble. But its stupid and I hope I don’t end up like that. Like they’re happily married and like love each other still, but like boring GOD so boring. I mean like their version of an exciting night is like going to the movies with another couple who’s kids have graduated and then like getting a beer. And like maybe that’s what I’ll want when I’m 55 and 56 but I cannot imagine that being what I ever want. And like God I love them but like no not for me.
C: So how long have they been together, or married?
D: They started dating in college. They dated for seven years before they got engaged and I think they’ve been married now for thirty years.
C: So how much older are your sisters?
D: The oldest is 6 years older than me, and then its 4 and then its like a year and a half. So 25, 23, and 21. Yeah, we’re all within 6 years.
C: So they were married when they had all of the kids?
D: Yeah.
C: And now can you talk a little bit more about your relationship experiences? You mentioned you had a boyfriend in high school who was two years older. So how old were you?
D: Um. We started dating-
C: You can make up a name for him too
D: Okay, I started dating Nathan. We were best friends my sophomore year in high school, his senior year. And then we didn’t hook up or start dating or anything until the summer of my going into senior year and his sophomore. No, the summer of me going into my senior year and his sophomore year yeah no that’s right. So we were friends like a long time in high school and then he went away and that was fine and like I wasn’t into it, and this is gonna be such a long story but um. But, he was like really into it when we were  just friends and then clearly when he goes away I like realized oh look I liked him, can’t, whatever. So then we like started dating over the summer and like decided to stay dating when like he went away to college. Like just keep talking about it?
C: Yeah, just however much-
D: I would visit him and he would come home for the breaks and like I didn’t mind the long distance thing cause there was just literally no one else I was interested in my high school in at all so like that was nice.
C: And where did he go to school?
D: Bowdoin. So it was like eight hours for me to visit him, but like I did it like three times his first, the first year that we were dating.
C: And when did you guys breakup?
D: We broke up the spring of my senior year in high school, so I guess we weren’t even dating for a full year. But like, we had been friends for like three years, but like, interesting, I never thought about that. But like yeah we broke up the spring my senior year in high school and it was funny cause like when we got together I was like oh I don’t know why we’re dating, like you’re in college, you should experience college and like not have a girlfriend in high school, like how lame is that. But he wanted to date me and I was like fine I have nothing else to do. And that sounds like very callous of me but that happened. And then by the time I decided where I was going to college and was getting ready to go away, I was like not into having a boyfriend so we broke up when I was still in high school and like still hooked up over the summer but like knew we weren’t staying together.
C: So that was your only boyfriend in high school?
D: Yeah.
C: And have you dated at all here?
D: Nope.
C: Do you think there are a lot of dating couples on campus?
D: No, its, you see a few juniors or seniors dating people but that’s like a rare thing to see I think
C: So how would you define like the term committed relationship?
D: At Colgate?
C: Just in general.
D: Well in general, exclusive so you don’t hookup with other people, you’re seeing them everyday if your like in close like if its not a long distance relationship but like you’re talking to them everyday if it is, what else… you hang out with them a lot. But at Colgate committed relationship kind of equals like for some people, just not hooking up with other people but just hooking up with each other when you’re out. And that’s not like a committed relationship and like some people do soberly hang out and like go on dates and that’s fine but yeah. (laughs). I’m sorry.
C: Have you had a committed relationship even if it wasn’t like dating or anything here?
D: No.
C: So the last thing you would define as a committed relationship would be in-
D: in high school, yes
C: So what are your beliefs toward marriage and how important is that to you?
D: Um, its marriage. I’m not like against marriage and I know I’ll probably end up married but like right now its really hard to imagine someone being like yeah why not let me just say I’ll spend the rest of my life with you, like I don’t understand why you need to say that if you want to. But then I do get that there’s like legal issues like custody over children and property and money blah-blah-blah so like I get marriage in that sense but its just like if you’re gonna be with them forever why don’t you just be with them forever? I don’t know.
C: So just like living with them and stuff like that?
D: Yeah and like in my experience making things official and putting labels on things just scares me off and like its really dumb but it makes it much more serious and more intense and its much more intimidating, so I guess that’s the best word to describe my stance right now, is that I’m intimidated by it but like I’m also not someone who’s gonna say like oh I’m never gonna get married because I know like I probably will and I’m sure I’ll be happy but it just seems very far off and like not very relevant to my life right now.
C: So its not something that you’re like directly thinking about right now?
D: No, not at all.
C: What do you think your parents hopes or opinions are surrounding your future relationships or marriage are?
D: The day I moved into Colgate, my dad turned to me cause like my parents loved the guy I dated, Nathan, they loved Nathan. He was like literally any parents dream come true, like really polite, nice, smart, got into Bowdoin and was running cross-country there, really independent, responsible basically a safe guy… even though he clearly wasn’t like he got me into drinking, drugs, sex like he basically like any bad influence he could have on me he did… but he held up that façade for my parents which was great, but back to the story. So my dad turned to me when he moved me into Colgate and he goes, I think that you should marry Nathan and I was just like WHAT THE FUCK what are you talking about? I think he got really intimidated and realized that I was going away for four years with out their supervision to a party school and like now constantly asking me and all my sisters like why don’t you have a boyfriend, when are you gonna get married? Kind of as a joke but also like slightly concerned that he has four daughters and none of them are even close to being near in a relationship let alone engaged or married. So I think that’s like their next step for them like oh our kids our in college, next they’ll be married and like moving into a house, so I think like they’re ready for that cause like my oldest sisters like 25 so that’s fine, so like her step is there, but like they’re kind of skipping over my step as like being a 19 year old in college and like shoving me in with my sisters. So like yeah there are expectations for that but like that’s just not even relevant to me right now.
C: So like they want you to get married and stuff but you aren’t too concerned about the fact that they want you to get married at this point.
D: Yeah and like when I tell them that’s not something I’m thinking about at this point they’re like oh yeah that’s true like you’re 19 and you’re in college but then other times they’re like oh we just want you to be happy and we don’t want you to be alone- like they equate the two and I’m like, I’d be perfectly, like I like my alone time (laughs). Like I think I would be perfectly fine not getting married. But yeah they want me to get married and have kids.
C: So can you describe your relationship with your parents a little bit? Are you like close with them?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: You said you had sisters you talked about.
D: Yeah, yeah, as much as I can remember like before I went to college like we just like fought all the time or like weren’t that close. Like in middle school or early high school my parents were more concerned with like my older sisters because like they were the ones that like fighting with them and causing problems and then I was home alone my junior and senior year cause all of my sisters were out of the house so I got more attention from them and I think we got closer because I was like the last kid but they also like started fighting with me more. So like we had a stronger relationship, but like that might not necessarily mean we had a better one because we were fighting so much. But now that I’m in college I think that like I’ve matured a lot, like its not that, it wasn’t my parents fault at all, I was being a little whiney bitch in high school and that’s the reason we fought. But now when I come home I feel a lot closer and I feel a lot more comfortable talking to them about drinking and drugs and like they know that I smoke pot sometimes and like they know that I drink all the time, um, I don’t explicitly talk about hooking up with them, but they know it happens, so I think being away and like having my own independence without having to fight against them at home has made us closer if anything. And like the same goes for my sisters, like they went through the same rebellious thing in high school but now they’re much more mature and nicer to my parents as well now that they’re away from them.
C: And, just kind of going back when we were talking a little bit ago about marriage. When you think about relationships in college, do you ever think that a college relationship could lead to marriage.
D: Like I said it doesn’t seem very relevant to my life right now so I don’t think about it that much, but like I do see seniors who are graduating right now and my question is always like oh are you gonna stay together cause like that seems valid like why just break up if you’re really into this person and I realize that I’m asking like oh are you gonna stay together and then like the next question is like what next, like what is in plan for your future?
C: Like if you stay together, what comes next?
D: Yeah, if you stay together then like that means like you see a future beyond college, which means like dating in the real world, getting engaged, and getting married. Like there’s nothing really else that like why else would you stay with them. And like what’s the statistic at Colgate like 30% of people meet their spouse here? I don’t know. So I guess it’s in the back of my mind, but its still really weird for me to think about.
C: So you think, you’ve been talking mostly about juniors and seniors, do you think that’s when most of the like dating and relationships happen?
D: Yeah, I don’t get the point of dating anyone your first year like why? I don’t know. Like for me I guess, I don’t know, that was my time to like do whatever the fuck I wanted and like I feel like if I had dated anyone my freshman year I would regret it now just cause like I was all over the place and like I had fun being on my own freshman year, and sophomore year its like oh a consistent hookup would be nice but like never dating like I wouldn’t have time like I LITERALLY wouldn’t have time for that and like I can’t like going on dates and hanging out and stuff is one thing but like its also like constantly texting someone and like that’s a lot of time and like constantly thinking about someone that also takes a lot of time, it actually does. So like freshman and sophomore year- ehh. But like junior and senior year I can see the appeal cause like you’ve been on campus for four years and like what else are you gonna do unless like you want to keep hooking up, which is fine, like that might happen to me but, um, but yeah to answer your question yeah I think it’s mainly juniors and seniors that are dating.
C: And do you think that’s across all, like men prefer that more or women prefer that more?
D: To stereo-type, I think women would date anyone at any point in their college career, I would say like some of my friends are completely against that and like prove that stereotype wrong, but like I think yeah females are much more open to dating at any point where guys are just like you can’t tie me down.
C: And do you think women thing about marriage at all here?
D: Ahh, I hope not. (laughs) but yeah I think that they do, not in like the crazy, like I don’t want to make them all out to seem like super crazy and like oh I just have to find a husband but I think that like girls here are much more realistic about dating and like what that relationship is where as guys just like cant think further than two weeks.
C: So can you also speak more on your ideas on sexual experience. On a first date, like an actual date,  what do you feel is the most appropriate level of physical contact?
D: I guess it depends on the guy, which like sounds really bad, but like if you’re into it lets, see. So this is like a date? Like you go out to dinner?
C: Yeah. 
D: Hm.
C: Okay well first of all do you think dating happens very often on Colgate’s campus?
D: No, no!
C: So do you think this question is irrelevant or do you think that every once in a while?
D: I mean, its kind of irrelevant but I’ll answer it anyway. I mean some people do go to dinner and watch a movie, rarely, but like, I guess the best description of a date that like I’ve seen happen like A FEW times on Colgate’s campus is like a guy coming over and like watching a movie in bed with a girl. Like that’s a date here. (laughs). So like in that sense?
C: Yeah, in that sense, we’ll do that.
D: So then like you go back to a dorm and you’re laying in bed like watching a movie and like you’re clearly going to hookup at the end of the movie or during the movie, um, so like make out obviously.
C: Is this sober or drunk?
D: Um, if it’s a date I would say sober, so like making out great that’s fine. Like I wouldn’t say have sex at all on a first date, no. Like oral sex? I would say I’m into it so like I would do it if I felt comfortable so like again that’s like is the guy nice? The main like I always draw for like going down on a guy is like um, like if its obvious that that’s all he’s interested in, like for some reason I just have this weird thought in my mind that like that’s all he wants then I’m not gonna give it to him, like I’m very stubborn in that sense, but like if its clear that that’s not all he wants then like ah yeah here’s your reward.
C: What do you mean by that’s all he wants?
D: Like if he like literally just wants to get head and get out of there cause like, I wouldn’t, like its pretty obvious when like that’s all that guys are interested in.
C: So does that go for drunk hookups too or just sober?
D: Well drunk hookups its harder to tall cause you’re drunk but like and I’m much more willing to give oral sex when I’m drunk so I don’t draw the line as much there , but like I still, basically if he’s a douche I’m not gonna to give it to him and if he’s not then I will. And like I kind of tell if he’s a douche or not based on the way he’s acting, like if he’s pushing it too much I get pissed off and like I don’t want to give him a blowjob like I just don’t want to because I’m stubborn and I like saying that its my call to make because it is, I think and whatever. So when he tries taking that decision away from me like I get really mad.
C: What do you mean taking the decision away from you?
D: Like when he says like oh but you have to or and I’m just like what no I don’t HAVE To what are you talking about (laughs) like you cant make me, so like yeah that’s just like how I decide, like how he’s acting and like how important it is to him and just if he’s nice to me or not
C: And you think guys are comfortable saying that?
D: What like saying you have to?
C: Yeah saying that or even just like asking.
D: Yeah, they’re completely comfortable. At least in my experience, and I know some people are like oh he didn’t even make a move so maybe I just pick really aggressive guys or maybe like I act very aggressively about it so they assume that I will. But I have had so many experiences where they are like come on you can’t just leave me like this, and I’m like I can, I wont feel guilty about it or like please, like sometimes when they ask its nicer, but also I’ve also just had people be like this is stupid, you should, and I’m just like no, I shouldn’t like leave me alone.
C: So you think there is like an expectation that guys have about it?
D: Yeah, like in my experience most, like its been a pleasant surprise when guys haven’t been expecting it, but I know that like I’ve talked to a lot of my friends that are like no he didn’t expect it at all, or like he didn’t make any moves towards it at all, so I don’t know if it’s just the way, am I a very aggressive kisser and like body gestures make it seem like I’m about to give him head, I don’t know.
C: And do you think that s a male specific thing, or do you think you, or your friends, or other women are just as likely to be aggressive about receiving oral sex as much as men are?
D: No, like I’ve never ever, like, been like oh you have to. Like I like oral sex, I do, but I’ve never been like you have to go down on me or like you can’t leave me like this, mostly because like they usually just finger me instead and I prefer that much more because its more pleasurable for me.
C: So like that’s a you thing?
D: Yeah and like I don’t think I’ve ever like wanted to be fingered or like eaten out and its not happened, so I don’t know if like I’d have to ask, but I would imagine if I were in a situation where I was giving him head and I wanted something I would be like yo.
C: So you would feel comfortable saying that?
D: Yeah.
C: And do you think most girls would feel comfortable saying that?
D: I guess it depends on how much they hookup. I mean I don’t think I would have been comfortable freshman year here but at this point I’ve hooked up enough and I don’t think guys would think its weird for me to ask them to do something because its like if they’re asking me, I might as well get something out of it too.
C: So do you think that you mentioned before, that men have an expectation that when they go home with someone that they’ll be receiving oral sex. Do you think that women have the same expectation?
D: No, like at least when I go home with someone I rarely am thinking like what I’m gonna get out of it and more like how far he’s gonna push it, cause it is always up to me like where I draw the line, so that’s always the thought process that goes through my mind so yeah no I never really have an expectation for it, I’m just always wondering what his expectations are for it.
C: And do you think that men think if they’re receiving oral sex that they should be giving it, or do you think that’s just not something that crosses their minds?
D: I think most, well not necessarily oral, but like I’ve never had a situation where like I gave someone head and they didn’t like finger me or like eat me out in return.
C: Would you say that’s a typical experience at Colgate?
D: I don’t know. I don’t know. I think for me its typical and its even like and say I’m on my period or like I don’t want it for whatever reason, they ask why not so like they want to kind of like do it, which I wouldn’t expect from a lot of the guys. But like as far as other people at Colgate, I guess I wouldn’t know. A lot of my friends like don’t talk about that or don’t like share those stories.
C: Talk about what?
D: Like if they come home from like hooking up with a guy, wither they don’t go that far because like they don’t feel comfortable going that far or like they feel weird being like, oh he ate me out or like oh I gave him a blowjob.
C: So do you think there’s a difference between being comfortable with saying oh he hate me out or oh I gave him a blowjob? Or do you think people would be equally open about those?
D: Um, I think people are more embarrassed to say oh he ate me out. Yeah cause like in my experience girls are like (squealing voice) eww he did it.. where as they’re just like oh yeah I gave him a blowjob. And like even me I’m just like, well first of all it’s a fucking weird ass phrase to say. Like EW.
C: It is a weird term.
D: Like I don’t think I’m that much of a prude but like that just freaks me out a little bit, but yeah I think there’s definitely a difference when you say it to someone between those two like giving and getting. People are more embarrassed to say that they got it.
C: And do you think that’s men too, like men are more embarrassed to say that they received too?
D: Oh, no
C: Oh, you think it’s gender specific?
D: Oh, yeah, (laughs), absolutely.
C: And do you think that expectations and stuff for oral sex depend on if people are dating or if its just a hookup?
D: Um, yeah, I guess so, so like two people that haven’t done oral sex at all yet like if they’re dating or not? Cause I guess like if they’re dating I’d assume that they already have, but you’re saying in this case that they already have and they’re dating?
C: Just like in general, like not necessarily how the relationship developed but just like two people. Like do you think that if they’re dating do you think that they’re likely to be giving and receiving oral sex like at the same levels?
D: I think they’re more likely because they’re probably more comfortable with each other
C: Do you think there’s a difference in like expectations that a man would have a woman and that a woman would have of a man?
D: Oh in a relationship?
C: Yeah.
D: In my experience, like when I dated Nathan, it was equal, but like he was also a very respectable guy, so like that may have mad a difference, but like if he expected something I expected it back. I don’t know, I think that when you’re dating each other, you both know or should know what each other want so there should be no difference in expectations or asking for it if you want it. But I know that’s not always the case, and in some cases, well most cases girls get embarrassed about it.
C: In relationships or hookups?
D: Relationships.
C: And do you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Just in general how do I feel?
C: Yeah just in general, like can you describe it?
D: I think a lot of people think it’s a bad thing and in some cases it is because like it kind of ruins other relationships from forming, but that’s also the drinking culture that plays a huge part in that…but I like it. We didn’t have hookups in my high school so it was really new for me freshman year but at this point I enjoy it. I enjoy the random hookups. Some people regret them but I don’t, I prefer them.
C: So you think that’s what the hookup culture around here is mostly?
D: Yeah every once in a while you get consistent hookups but it still ends up being, in my experience, getting drunk and ending up in the same guy’s room.
C: So you think the drinking culture and hookup culture are related?
D: Yeah, I think one is the reason for the other, and they just feed into each other.
C: And which one do you think is the-
D: The drinking culture makes the hookup culture the way it is…but I also think a lot of people drink for the reasons of getting someone to hookup with so in a way they both just sort of work together.
C: And so you said you enjoy the hookup culture, do you also enjoy the drinking culture?
D: Yes.
C: Do you think that Colgate’s organized, sexuality based initiatives have had any affect on the sexual climate at Colgate?
D: Um, I don’t think in the larger picture it’s affected anything. Like going out its still the same thing, but personally I think I’ve embraced it more. Like I went to “This is not a Play About Sex” and like I thought that was really awesome and like that’s why I’m much more into the hookup culture now cause it wasn’t really bashing the culture on campus, it was just kind of saying, this is how it is and like I really liked that perspective on it. As for like bystander intervention, I haven’t been a part of it. Uh what’s the other one? Where you sit around in a group, or you get into groups. What is it? It was like every Tuesday night like ******** was a part of it? Fuck what was it? I don’t know, but it’s just where people voluntarily sign up to talk about their sex life in like small discussion groups. I’ll figure out the name to it. That apparently was very good and helpful. I haven’t been a part of it, but I think a lot of individuals say the initiatives are really good on campus, but I’m not sure how much of an effect it has collectively.
C: Okay.
D: Yeah, sorry.
C: No, that was good.
C: Does Colgate’s general culture promote an idea of sexuality that’s different than how you grew up, I know you mentioned there weren’t hookups in high school.
D: Yeah, absolutely. People only hooked up with someone they were dating, for a while, whether that’s like oral sex or sex sex. So coming here I was like ashamed for having drunk hookups like when I was hooking up with two guys in two nights or two guys in two months like I kind of looked down on it, I was like oh that’s gross and slutty, but it’s definitely changed being on this campus has definitely changed my perception of it. Like its not necessarily something I’m proud of but its not something I’m ashamed of anymore either.
C: And do you think that’s Colgate specific or do you think that’s how a lot of transitions are from high school to college in general?
D: Yeah I think that’s just a transition in general. Like high school is just awkward and weird anyway and like college is still awkward and weird and like I bet you its gonna be a weird transition leaving college and going into the real world too but I don’t want to think about that right now.
C: So you think it’s just kind of college not specifically Colgate?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: Do you think it differs at all from like a small school to a big school?
D: I don’t really know. Most of my friends go to small schools like Colgate so I can’t really compare. I’d imagine it’s a lot less weird because you don’t run into the hookup that you had last night like five times on campus the next day because that happens to me literally every time. So, there’s that difference, but, I think some bigger schools would push even more of a hookup culture because it’s such a random and anonymous thing like you wont see them the next day.
C: Can you describe the social scene at Colgate?
D: Like the drinking scene?
C: Just in general the social scene.
D: My experience has just been going out. (laughs). I mean I have friends that I go out with and I guess I made them in sober contexts, but most of the people I meet now I meet out in a bar or a fraternity, um, so that’s the extent of my social experience. It’s fun, I have a lot of fun drinking, but it inhibits any social interactions when you’re sober. I don’t think people really know how to communicate when they’re sober, um, and people think it’s weird when you hang out with your friends, your guy friends, or your friends of the opposite sex if you’re sober. They think that means that your into them or that you’re dating or something weird and I hate that more than anything.
C: So you think the social scene is mainly focused around drinking?
D: Yes.
C: And are there different- Does everyone participate in the drinking scene or are there certain-
D: I think the Greek community is probably the biggest. I know that there are some people that don’t drink at all on campus and some people that do drink just as much as anyone in a frat or a sorority, but a lot of the people who do go out to drink end up at a frat. Some people do just go straight to bars, but, yeah it think the biggest group on campus would be the Greek life people.
C: And do you think athletics fit into the social scene at all, being a division one school?
D: Not in my experience. I know a lot of people go to  (varsity male sport) parties after a big win or to the (different varsity male sport) frat after a big win for (that varsity male sport). But personally it hasn’t really affected anything, like tailgating isn’t really a big thing. It’s weird cause we have D 1 athletics but a lot of people just don’t give a shit about it. (laughs)
C: Do you think your social experience at Colgate would be different if you were a different race or ethnicity?
D: Yes.
C: How do you think it would be different?
D: I guess I wouldn’t really know until I was put in their shoes, but there’s a huge stigma surrounded by international students and that um without even considering international students, just people of different colors or ethnicities, um, for the most part. That’s a huge generalization and its not true in all aspects but like I think that they have formed different social groups, whether by choice or just by the white majority of people excluding them from social events… which sounds awful.
C: So you’re talking about minorities and international students?
D: Yeah.
C: Okay, and do you think that they, do you see them mixing together or are those groups kept separate?
D: I think those are pretty separate. The international students are very close because they are dealing with um, I mean I’m sure they can relate with each other the best, better than anyone else can, but yeah they’re very separate from other ethnicities on campus.
C: So what do you think their social experience is like?
D: No idea. Sounds really bad, but I’m not really aware of what they do socially. I’m sure some of them go out and drink and maybe I just don’t see it, wow I’m awful, but I think a lot of them, at least from the few that I’ve met, they, um, stay in on the weekends for the most part. They hang out with friends but they don’t go downtown.
C: And what would you say the minority students’ social scene is like?
D: Uh, this is another generalization, but I think they’re a little more comfortable going downtown and to frats cause I guess like they’re used to the American party culture, whereas international students aren’t necessarily used to that, but I still think they’re pretty ostracized from like the typical Colgate: frat, Jug, Bacon, Slices night. I don’t know, maybe I don’t see them as much when I’m out either, but I just don’t notice them when out much.
C: And do you think race ethnicity has an effect on the hookup culture at all?
D: I think so. Not in the sense that I think people are racist and won’t hookup with other people of different ethnicities, at least personally I’m not. But I think it’s because socially they’re more isolate, like the hookup culture is the social culture. So because that group is isolated from the general population at Colgate, there’s not really a chance for those groups to hookup across racial lines.
C: And do you think gender has an effect on the social experience at Colgate?
D: Yeah, a lot. In a lot of ways.
C: Can you give some examples?
D: Well I mean first of all there’s six fraternities on campus um and only three sororities. And like I said, Greek life is a huge part of the social life. That is just obvious that there’s a lot more opportunities for guys to get involved than for girls and fraternities are allowed to host things while sororities aren’t, like host social events while sororities aren’t. That’s another huge thing, like we’re only allowed to be guests at social events, and guys have the control of basically any party that they want to throw.
D: Do you want to put in that I’m a social chair of a sorority?
C:  Yeah, you can say that. You can say whatever you want on here.
D: Yeah so like I didn’t realize, um, how true that is, but like you’d think that like as a social chair that I’d have like a lot of control over what our sorority does socially, but like I don’t really. I like give them dates that are open, and they take them or they cancel on us or they change the theme, change the place, change the date or time, um, so like, I’m not that much of a feminist, but like in that sense, it really pisses me off that girls don’t have more of a say, because when it comes to social life, like without girls guys wouldn’t have any fun when they’re out but like we don’t get to have any influence on like what we’re doing when we’re out, we just have to go to the frats cause that’s just basically all we have.
C: And do you think that gender has an influence on the hookup culture?
D: Yeah. Not, like, I said that Colgate girls and guys, I guess everyone, can like own up to their sexuality, hookup is fine and celebrated. But I’ve seen some things that guys do when they’re out, like hooking up with three different girls within an hour, and then that happens to a girl and that’s just, they get shat on for doing something like that. Guys get to like fist-bump their fraternity brothers and girls are like oh you’re a sloppy slut like you need to go home and like regret your actions. Um, and yeah maybe they probably shouldn’t have done that, but its just a very big double standard that if girls are very aggressive about their sexuality then its like considered slutty, but if guys are then its considered being a bro.
C: And do you find that more prominent or specific to Colgate or just college in general?
D: Colgate’s my main experience with like a hookup culture like this, but like I think its pretty fair to say that’s something in general.
C: And do you think that goes on outside of the drinking culture, or do you think that double is held when alcohol is not involved?
D: No, I think its held when alcohols not involved. Like I said, I don’t have much experience with sober hookup cultures, but I think its just a thing in societies where your drinking or not.
C: And, now just changing a little bit. Growing up, how did your family or friends influence your identity?
D: Oooh such a deep question. Um. I had three older sisters, so ill start with the family, so I clearly had three obvious role models, well role models in the sense that they were the three people that I looked up to most directly. Not necessarily that they were the best people to look up to, but I think that’s how they affected my identity in a way. Like they fucked up a lot, and got in trouble a lot, and like I was the younger sister listening to them get grounded or like get in trouble with my parents so like I saw that happen, so I think that made me a little but more rebellious, and I think it also made my parents much more lenient by the time I got to high school and had to deal with things like that. And when I say fucked up I mean like drinking and drugs and whatever and stuff like that. So I think that was a huge part of me going into high school and college cause like I had seen it happen and I was just like oh my sisters turned out fine so I was much more open and exposed to drinking and hooking up than my friends who didn’t have three older sisters were. And then when it came to friends, they kind of had the opposite affect on me. Like they were, to put it bluntly, kind of prude in high school. Like when I told them I lost my virginity they were like what the heck you’ve only been dating this guy for like six months and I was like EXACTLY, SIX fucking months like. I mean granted I was like two years younger than him but like, I don’t know, we were dating and like I was completely fine with it, but like they were just so shocked and appalled by it that it was just like what the heck I don’t know. So I got conflicting views from my friends and my family I think. My parents didn’t really play a part in it. I don’t fucking talk to my parents about this shit and I never fucking will. They agree, like I think that they know that I’m like mature enough to make my decisions so they respect my uh uh personal space when it comes to that.
C: So you don’t talk to your parents about sex at all?
D: Um, they know that I’m on birth control, now I’m not on birth control. So I talk to them about that. And they know that I’ve had sex and they know more- or they assume more than one person
C: How do they know that you’ve had sex?
D: It’s like an unspoken thing. I was dating this guys for like a year and a half, it was a pretty serious. And they liked him and like and like I went and visited him at college when he was in college and I was in high school. Like they aren’t naïve like they went through this with four girls so like they assumed it. They probably don’t know that like I have sex here more than like, with more than like, like with someone who’s less than my boyfriend. They probably still think that I’m just having sex with someone who means more to me than a random hookup. But they definitely know that I’ve done it. I’m trying to think of what else. This is funny… I was telling my parents about the whole rape situation on campus and how its hard sometimes to figure out if its rape or not cause people just get really really drunk and my dad just flat out asked me do you have drunk sex and I flat out told him like I’m not having this conversation with you and my mom just looked at him like he was crazy so I think he is a little more comfortable at this point talking about things like that, but like we still don’t really, like I also have my friends and my sisters to talk about things like that so I don’t feel like I need to talk to my mom about things like that sex related, God.
C: So your friends and sisters kind of filled that?
D: Yeah, mhm.
C: So are your parents married and living together?
D: Yes, yes.
C: And can you talk a little bit about their marriage 
D: Its really fucking boring. I don’t know. They like, is say boring but I guess that means stable. And like they always say that, like I say how boring their lives are and they like all their kids are gone and they can do whatever they want but they’re always like boring is good, boring means no trouble. But its stupid and I hope I don’t end up like that. Like they’re happily married and like love each other still, but like boring GOD so boring. I mean like their version of an exciting night is like going to the movies with another couple who’s kids have graduated and then like getting a beer. And like maybe that’s what I’ll want when I’m 55 and 56 but I cannot imagine that being what I ever want. And like God I love them but like no not for me.
C: So how long have they been together, or married?
D: They started dating in college. They dated for seven years before they got engaged and I think they’ve been married now for thirty years.
C: So how much older are your sisters?
D: The oldest is 6 years older than me, and then its 4 and then its like a year and a half. So 25, 23, and 21. Yeah, we’re all within 6 years.
C: So they were married when they had all of the kids?
D: Yeah.
C: And now can you talk a little bit more about your relationship experiences? You mentioned you had a boyfriend in high school who was two years older. So how old were you?
D: Um. We started dating-
C: You can make up a name for him too
D: Okay, I started dating Nathan. We were best friends my sophomore year in high school, his senior year. And then we didn’t hook up or start dating or anything until the summer of my going into senior year and his sophomore. No, the summer of me going into my senior year and his sophomore year yeah no that’s right. So we were friends like a long time in high school and then he went away and that was fine and like I wasn’t into it, and this is gonna be such a long story but um. But, he was like really into it when we were  just friends and then clearly when he goes away I like realized oh look I liked him, can’t, whatever. So then we like started dating over the summer and like decided to stay dating when like he went away to college. Like just keep talking about it?
C: Yeah, just however much-
D: I would visit him and he would come home for the breaks and like I didn’t mind the long distance thing cause there was just literally no one else I was interested in my high school in at all so like that was nice.
C: And where did he go to school?
D: Bowdoin. So it was like eight hours for me to visit him, but like I did it like three times his first, the first year that we were dating.
C: And when did you guys breakup?
D: We broke up the spring of my senior year in high school, so I guess we weren’t even dating for a full year. But like, we had been friends for like three years, but like, interesting, I never thought about that. But like yeah we broke up the spring my senior year in high school and it was funny cause like when we got together I was like oh I don’t know why we’re dating, like you’re in college, you should experience college and like not have a girlfriend in high school, like how lame is that. But he wanted to date me and I was like fine I have nothing else to do. And that sounds like very callous of me but that happened. And then by the time I decided where I was going to college and was getting ready to go away, I was like not into having a boyfriend so we broke up when I was still in high school and like still hooked up over the summer but like knew we weren’t staying together.
C: So that was your only boyfriend in high school?
D: Yeah.
C: And have you dated at all here?
D: Nope.
C: Do you think there are a lot of dating couples on campus?
D: No, its, you see a few juniors or seniors dating people but that’s like a rare thing to see I think
C: So how would you define like the term committed relationship?
D: At Colgate?
C: Just in general.
D: Well in general, exclusive so you don’t hookup with other people, you’re seeing them everyday if your like in close like if its not a long distance relationship but like you’re talking to them everyday if it is, what else… you hang out with them a lot. But at Colgate committed relationship kind of equals like for some people, just not hooking up with other people but just hooking up with each other when you’re out. And that’s not like a committed relationship and like some people do soberly hang out and like go on dates and that’s fine but yeah. (laughs). I’m sorry.
C: Have you had a committed relationship even if it wasn’t like dating or anything here?
D: No.
C: So the last thing you would define as a committed relationship would be in-
D: in high school, yes
C: So what are your beliefs toward marriage and how important is that to you?
D: Um, its marriage. I’m not like against marriage and I know I’ll probably end up married but like right now its really hard to imagine someone being like yeah why not let me just say I’ll spend the rest of my life with you, like I don’t understand why you need to say that if you want to. But then I do get that there’s like legal issues like custody over children and property and money blah-blah-blah so like I get marriage in that sense but its just like if you’re gonna be with them forever why don’t you just be with them forever? I don’t know.
C: So just like living with them and stuff like that?
D: Yeah and like in my experience making things official and putting labels on things just scares me off and like its really dumb but it makes it much more serious and more intense and its much more intimidating, so I guess that’s the best word to describe my stance right now, is that I’m intimidated by it but like I’m also not someone who’s gonna say like oh I’m never gonna get married because I know like I probably will and I’m sure I’ll be happy but it just seems very far off and like not very relevant to my life right now.
C: So its not something that you’re like directly thinking about right now?
D: No, not at all.
C: What do you think your parents hopes or opinions are surrounding your future relationships or marriage are?
D: The day I moved into Colgate, my dad turned to me cause like my parents loved the guy I dated, Nathan, they loved Nathan. He was like literally any parents dream come true, like really polite, nice, smart, got into Bowdoin and was running cross-country there, really independent, responsible basically a safe guy… even though he clearly wasn’t like he got me into drinking, drugs, sex like he basically like any bad influence he could have on me he did… but he held up that façade for my parents which was great, but back to the story. So my dad turned to me when he moved me into Colgate and he goes, I think that you should marry Nathan and I was just like WHAT THE FUCK what are you talking about? I think he got really intimidated and realized that I was going away for four years with out their supervision to a party school and like now constantly asking me and all my sisters like why don’t you have a boyfriend, when are you gonna get married? Kind of as a joke but also like slightly concerned that he has four daughters and none of them are even close to being near in a relationship let alone engaged or married. So I think that’s like their next step for them like oh our kids our in college, next they’ll be married and like moving into a house, so I think like they’re ready for that cause like my oldest sisters like 25 so that’s fine, so like her step is there, but like they’re kind of skipping over my step as like being a 19 year old in college and like shoving me in with my sisters. So like yeah there are expectations for that but like that’s just not even relevant to me right now.
C: So like they want you to get married and stuff but you aren’t too concerned about the fact that they want you to get married at this point.
D: Yeah and like when I tell them that’s not something I’m thinking about at this point they’re like oh yeah that’s true like you’re 19 and you’re in college but then other times they’re like oh we just want you to be happy and we don’t want you to be alone- like they equate the two and I’m like, I’d be perfectly, like I like my alone time (laughs). Like I think I would be perfectly fine not getting married. But yeah they want me to get married and have kids.
C: So can you describe your relationship with your parents a little bit? Are you like close with them?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: You said you had sisters you talked about.
D: Yeah, yeah, as much as I can remember like before I went to college like we just like fought all the time or like weren’t that close. Like in middle school or early high school my parents were more concerned with like my older sisters because like they were the ones that like fighting with them and causing problems and then I was home alone my junior and senior year cause all of my sisters were out of the house so I got more attention from them and I think we got closer because I was like the last kid but they also like started fighting with me more. So like we had a stronger relationship, but like that might not necessarily mean we had a better one because we were fighting so much. But now that I’m in college I think that like I’ve matured a lot, like its not that, it wasn’t my parents fault at all, I was being a little whiney bitch in high school and that’s the reason we fought. But now when I come home I feel a lot closer and I feel a lot more comfortable talking to them about drinking and drugs and like they know that I smoke pot sometimes and like they know that I drink all the time, um, I don’t explicitly talk about hooking up with them, but they know it happens, so I think being away and like having my own independence without having to fight against them at home has made us closer if anything. And like the same goes for my sisters, like they went through the same rebellious thing in high school but now they’re much more mature and nicer to my parents as well now that they’re away from them.
C: And, just kind of going back when we were talking a little bit ago about marriage. When you think about relationships in college, do you ever think that a college relationship could lead to marriage.
D: Like I said it doesn’t seem very relevant to my life right now so I don’t think about it that much, but like I do see seniors who are graduating right now and my question is always like oh are you gonna stay together cause like that seems valid like why just break up if you’re really into this person and I realize that I’m asking like oh are you gonna stay together and then like the next question is like what next, like what is in plan for your future?
C: Like if you stay together, what comes next?
D: Yeah, if you stay together then like that means like you see a future beyond college, which means like dating in the real world, getting engaged, and getting married. Like there’s nothing really else that like why else would you stay with them. And like what’s the statistic at Colgate like 30% of people meet their spouse here? I don’t know. So I guess it’s in the back of my mind, but its still really weird for me to think about.
C: So you think, you’ve been talking mostly about juniors and seniors, do you think that’s when most of the like dating and relationships happen?
D: Yeah, I don’t get the point of dating anyone your first year like why? I don’t know. Like for me I guess, I don’t know, that was my time to like do whatever the fuck I wanted and like I feel like if I had dated anyone my freshman year I would regret it now just cause like I was all over the place and like I had fun being on my own freshman year, and sophomore year its like oh a consistent hookup would be nice but like never dating like I wouldn’t have time like I LITERALLY wouldn’t have time for that and like I can’t like going on dates and hanging out and stuff is one thing but like its also like constantly texting someone and like that’s a lot of time and like constantly thinking about someone that also takes a lot of time, it actually does. So like freshman and sophomore year- ehh. But like junior and senior year I can see the appeal cause like you’ve been on campus for four years and like what else are you gonna do unless like you want to keep hooking up, which is fine, like that might happen to me but, um, but yeah to answer your question yeah I think it’s mainly juniors and seniors that are dating.
C: And do you think that’s across all, like men prefer that more or women prefer that more?
D: To stereo-type, I think women would date anyone at any point in their college career, I would say like some of my friends are completely against that and like prove that stereotype wrong, but like I think yeah females are much more open to dating at any point where guys are just like you can’t tie me down.
C: And do you think women thing about marriage at all here?
D: Ahh, I hope not. (laughs) but yeah I think that they do, not in like the crazy, like I don’t want to make them all out to seem like super crazy and like oh I just have to find a husband but I think that like girls here are much more realistic about dating and like what that relationship is where as guys just like cant think further than two weeks.
C: So can you also speak more on your ideas on sexual experience. On a first date, like an actual date,  what do you feel is the most appropriate level of physical contact?
D: I guess it depends on the guy, which like sounds really bad, but like if you’re into it lets, see. So this is like a date? Like you go out to dinner?
C: Yeah. 
D: Hm.
C: Okay well first of all do you think dating happens very often on Colgate’s campus?
D: No, no!
C: So do you think this question is irrelevant or do you think that every once in a while?
D: I mean, its kind of irrelevant but I’ll answer it anyway. I mean some people do go to dinner and watch a movie, rarely, but like, I guess the best description of a date that like I’ve seen happen like A FEW times on Colgate’s campus is like a guy coming over and like watching a movie in bed with a girl. Like that’s a date here. (laughs). So like in that sense?
C: Yeah, in that sense, we’ll do that.
D: So then like you go back to a dorm and you’re laying in bed like watching a movie and like you’re clearly going to hookup at the end of the movie or during the movie, um, so like make out obviously.
C: Is this sober or drunk?
D: Um, if it’s a date I would say sober, so like making out great that’s fine. Like I wouldn’t say have sex at all on a first date, no. Like oral sex? I would say I’m into it so like I would do it if I felt comfortable so like again that’s like is the guy nice? The main like I always draw for like going down on a guy is like um, like if its obvious that that’s all he’s interested in, like for some reason I just have this weird thought in my mind that like that’s all he wants then I’m not gonna give it to him, like I’m very stubborn in that sense, but like if its clear that that’s not all he wants then like ah yeah here’s your reward.
C: What do you mean by that’s all he wants?
D: Like if he like literally just wants to get head and get out of there cause like, I wouldn’t, like its pretty obvious when like that’s all that guys are interested in.
C: So does that go for drunk hookups too or just sober?
D: Well drunk hookups its harder to tall cause you’re drunk but like and I’m much more willing to give oral sex when I’m drunk so I don’t draw the line as much there , but like I still, basically if he’s a douche I’m not gonna to give it to him and if he’s not then I will. And like I kind of tell if he’s a douche or not based on the way he’s acting, like if he’s pushing it too much I get pissed off and like I don’t want to give him a blowjob like I just don’t want to because I’m stubborn and I like saying that its my call to make because it is, I think and whatever. So when he tries taking that decision away from me like I get really mad.
C: What do you mean taking the decision away from you?
D: Like when he says like oh but you have to or and I’m just like what no I don’t HAVE To what are you talking about (laughs) like you cant make me, so like yeah that’s just like how I decide, like how he’s acting and like how important it is to him and just if he’s nice to me or not
C: And you think guys are comfortable saying that?
D: What like saying you have to?
C: Yeah saying that or even just like asking.
D: Yeah, they’re completely comfortable. At least in my experience, and I know some people are like oh he didn’t even make a move so maybe I just pick really aggressive guys or maybe like I act very aggressively about it so they assume that I will. But I have had so many experiences where they are like come on you can’t just leave me like this, and I’m like I can, I wont feel guilty about it or like please, like sometimes when they ask its nicer, but also I’ve also just had people be like this is stupid, you should, and I’m just like no, I shouldn’t like leave me alone.
C: So you think there is like an expectation that guys have about it?
D: Yeah, like in my experience most, like its been a pleasant surprise when guys haven’t been expecting it, but I know that like I’ve talked to a lot of my friends that are like no he didn’t expect it at all, or like he didn’t make any moves towards it at all, so I don’t know if it’s just the way, am I a very aggressive kisser and like body gestures make it seem like I’m about to give him head, I don’t know.
C: And do you think that s a male specific thing, or do you think you, or your friends, or other women are just as likely to be aggressive about receiving oral sex as much as men are?
D: No, like I’ve never ever, like, been like oh you have to. Like I like oral sex, I do, but I’ve never been like you have to go down on me or like you can’t leave me like this, mostly because like they usually just finger me instead and I prefer that much more because its more pleasurable for me.
C: So like that’s a you thing?
D: Yeah and like I don’t think I’ve ever like wanted to be fingered or like eaten out and its not happened, so I don’t know if like I’d have to ask, but I would imagine if I were in a situation where I was giving him head and I wanted something I would be like yo.
C: So you would feel comfortable saying that?
D: Yeah.
C: And do you think most girls would feel comfortable saying that?
D: I guess it depends on how much they hookup. I mean I don’t think I would have been comfortable freshman year here but at this point I’ve hooked up enough and I don’t think guys would think its weird for me to ask them to do something because its like if they’re asking me, I might as well get something out of it too.
C: So do you think that you mentioned before, that men have an expectation that when they go home with someone that they’ll be receiving oral sex. Do you think that women have the same expectation?
D: No, like at least when I go home with someone I rarely am thinking like what I’m gonna get out of it and more like how far he’s gonna push it, cause it is always up to me like where I draw the line, so that’s always the thought process that goes through my mind so yeah no I never really have an expectation for it, I’m just always wondering what his expectations are for it.
C: And do you think that men think if they’re receiving oral sex that they should be giving it, or do you think that’s just not something that crosses their minds?
D: I think most, well not necessarily oral, but like I’ve never had a situation where like I gave someone head and they didn’t like finger me or like eat me out in return.
C: Would you say that’s a typical experience at Colgate?
D: I don’t know. I don’t know. I think for me its typical and its even like and say I’m on my period or like I don’t want it for whatever reason, they ask why not so like they want to kind of like do it, which I wouldn’t expect from a lot of the guys. But like as far as other people at Colgate, I guess I wouldn’t know. A lot of my friends like don’t talk about that or don’t like share those stories.
C: Talk about what?
D: Like if they come home from like hooking up with a guy, wither they don’t go that far because like they don’t feel comfortable going that far or like they feel weird being like, oh he ate me out or like oh I gave him a blowjob.
C: So do you think there’s a difference between being comfortable with saying oh he hate me out or oh I gave him a blowjob? Or do you think people would be equally open about those?
D: Um, I think people are more embarrassed to say oh he ate me out. Yeah cause like in my experience girls are like (squealing voice) eww he did it.. where as they’re just like oh yeah I gave him a blowjob. And like even me I’m just like, well first of all it’s a fucking weird ass phrase to say. Like EW.
C: It is a weird term.
D: Like I don’t think I’m that much of a prude but like that just freaks me out a little bit, but yeah I think there’s definitely a difference when you say it to someone between those two like giving and getting. People are more embarrassed to say that they got it.
C: And do you think that’s men too, like men are more embarrassed to say that they received too?
D: Oh, no
C: Oh, you think it’s gender specific?
D: Oh, yeah, (laughs), absolutely.
C: And do you think that expectations and stuff for oral sex depend on if people are dating or if its just a hookup?
D: Um, yeah, I guess so, so like two people that haven’t done oral sex at all yet like if they’re dating or not? Cause I guess like if they’re dating I’d assume that they already have, but you’re saying in this case that they already have and they’re dating?
C: Just like in general, like not necessarily how the relationship developed but just like two people. Like do you think that if they’re dating do you think that they’re likely to be giving and receiving oral sex like at the same levels?
D: I think they’re more likely because they’re probably more comfortable with each other
C: Do you think there’s a difference in like expectations that a man would have a woman and that a woman would have of a man?
D: Oh in a relationship?
C: Yeah.
D: In my experience, like when I dated Nathan, it was equal, but like he was also a very respectable guy, so like that may have mad a difference, but like if he expected something I expected it back. I don’t know, I think that when you’re dating each other, you both know or should know what each other want so there should be no difference in expectations or asking for it if you want it. But I know that’s not always the case, and in some cases, well most cases girls get embarrassed about it.
C: In relationships or hookups?
D: Relationships.
C: And do you think in relationships there’s more or less equality, like as far as the two go?
D: More equality but still I think its very male oriented as for how aggressive it is. But yeah much more equality than in like hooking up if you know what I mean?
C: So like guys would be expecting to give oral sex more if they were in a relationship?
D: Yeah, yeah, I think so.
C: So just changing a little bit again.
C: Tell me a little bit about what you know about contraception and its availability on campus.
D: Um, you can get free condoms on Fridays. Free condoms at women’s studies and at the health center. You can also pay for condoms like anywhere, like the C-store or like downtown. Like this also includes like birth control and stuff right?
C: yeah
D: I think like we’re on a campus where most students are well educated and wealthy so like there’s no reason for them to like not buy condoms or like not be on birth control, but like and like I think that holds true and I think most people are very responsible when it comes to that stuff, yeah.
C: So do you use any form of contraception?
D: I was on birth control and then I stopped for like hormone reasons, and I also wasn’t having sex, so like there wasn’t an reason for me to be on it. But like I have had sex since stopping it, but I still wear condoms, or like make the guy wear a condom.
C: And by birth control you mean?
D: The pill, sorry.
C: And what was your decision process in deciding to use the pill?
D: Why did I start it, or why did I pick the pill?
C: Both.
D: A. because I was already having sex with my boyfriend so I thought it was probably smart to start it and B. because like my period wasn’t regulated. So like it was a lot of a personal reason because like it helped regulate my period and also because like I was having sex so I should be on it. And like I chose the pill over other forms just because it was what I was most familiar with and like what my mom was most familiar with and like what my doctor gave me. Like I didn’t really look into any other forms. Like I know there’s a patch but that just seemed annoying.
C: Yeah, and did your partner have any say on the type of contraception or the decision to go on birth control?
D: Well when I was dating my boyfriend, we like I said we started having sex before I went on the pill but I think he was very happy when I went on it, but like he still was like we’re still wearing condoms because he was just very respectful and careful, but there were some points where like I know you don’t have an STD and I don’t have an STD and like I’m on the pill so like I was probably pushing it more than he was, um, so I think that he still had a say cause a lot of times he still wore condoms but sometimes I convinced him not to because sometimes it just feels so much better. SO much better without them! (laughs) but now like I completely understand why like understand why he, what was it like, there was one point in high school when I went on Plan B, or like I took Plan B because um, I was drunk and we didn’t use a condom and I had missed two pills in one week or something like that and like he went and bought it for me and like gave it to me, so like he was very proactive in that sense. Like I would have done it myself, but like he was probably safer than, yeah he was definitely safer than I was when it came to things like that. So like that’s weird. Whatever.
C: So would you say you’re safer about it now than you were in high school or would you say it’s the same?
D: I’m not having sex as regularly or like with as many peop- or like as many times, I guess that’s regularly… that’s the same thing, but yeah like I said I’m not on birth control now and like I said I’m much more like into the idea of using condoms and I make the guys use condoms all the time because like A. I’m not on the pill and like B. I don’t know where the fuck that penis has been, like especially on this campus, so like keep that thing on. Yeah I think I’m much more responsible than in high school. Like I was really stupid about that, like I thought that nothing could happen, and now I’m much better. Like I took plan B once in college because I was drunk and like apparently like the condom just like fell off or something but like in that case my boyfriend didn’t like go and get it, like I got it, like I’m much more accountable for stuff like that here than I was in high school and like when I was dating someone.
C: Okay, and just changing the subject one more time. What do you plan on doing after college?
D: Like with my life?
C: Yeah, like immediately after college, do you have any plans for what you even want to do? Have you thought about that at all?
D: (laughs) shit. I don’t know. I ponder that sometimes, I’m not too keen on going to graduate school right after like I’d like to work for a few years but like work doing what or go to graduate school for what? I don’t know. I think traveling is a huge part of what I want to do in my twenties. So like whether that’s going to graduate school abroad or trying to get a job that has me traveling, that’s like one thing that I know I want to do.
C: So do you think that if you started a relationship in college, would you see it continuing out of college? Like would you see a relationship at Colgate continuing on into your twenties?
D: I guess if I’m really into the guy then yeah.
C: And do you think that would influence what you decided to do at all?
D: No. Yeah that’s like the one thing that I was gonna saw with that previous one. Like I would date someone, but not if its gonna interrupt with anything I want to do.
C: And where do you see yourself in 10 years? So you’re 29.
D: Fuck. Hopefully still young. (laughs). I don’t know, that’s like getting up there, you’re almost 30. So I guess it’d be nice, like ideally you’d be dating someone seriously, maybe engaged, maybe even fucking married, like I don’t want kinds before I’m married that’s like one rule I know, but I’m not really gonna say like oh I’d like to be dating someone cause I don’t think you should put a timeline on it, like I think its more like if you meet someone that you would be interested in marrying then like you date them, but yeah, other than that like yeah I’d probably still be doing like what I want to do. Like hopefully I’d have like a steady job like at that point. Like I wouldn’t want to be traveling in ten years.
C: So like maybe married maybe not?
D: Maybe married, maybe not. All depends on if I meet someone.
C: So you don’t have a timeline?
D: Nope, no expectations.

C: I would like to star out by discussing aspects of positive sexuality on Colgate’s campus. How do you feel about Colgate’s hookup culture?
D: Just in general how do I feel?
C: Yeah just in general, like can you describe it?
D: I think a lot of people think it’s a bad thing and in some cases it is because like it kind of ruins other relationships from forming, but that’s also the drinking culture that plays a huge part in that…but I like it. We didn’t have hookups in my high school so it was really new for me freshman year but at this point I enjoy it. I enjoy the random hookups. Some people regret them but I don’t, I prefer them.
C: So you think that’s what the hookup culture around here is mostly?
D: Yeah every once in a while you get consistent hookups but it still ends up being, in my experience, getting drunk and ending up in the same guy’s room.
C: So you think the drinking culture and hookup culture are related?
D: Yeah, I think one is the reason for the other, and they just feed into each other.
C: And which one do you think is the-
D: The drinking culture makes the hookup culture the way it is…but I also think a lot of people drink for the reasons of getting someone to hookup with so in a way they both just sort of work together.
C: And so you said you enjoy the hookup culture, do you also enjoy the drinking culture?
D: Yes.
C: Do you think that Colgate’s organized, sexuality based initiatives have had any affect on the sexual climate at Colgate?
D: Um, I don’t think in the larger picture it’s affected anything. Like going out its still the same thing, but personally I think I’ve embraced it more. Like I went to “This is not a Play About Sex” and like I thought that was really awesome and like that’s why I’m much more into the hookup culture now cause it wasn’t really bashing the culture on campus, it was just kind of saying, this is how it is and like I really liked that perspective on it. As for like bystander intervention, I haven’t been a part of it. Uh what’s the other one? Where you sit around in a group, or you get into groups. What is it? It was like every Tuesday night like ******** was a part of it? Fuck what was it? I don’t know, but it’s just where people voluntarily sign up to talk about their sex life in like small discussion groups. I’ll figure out the name to it. That apparently was very good and helpful. I haven’t been a part of it, but I think a lot of individuals say the initiatives are really good on campus, but I’m not sure how much of an effect it has collectively.
C: Okay.
D: Yeah, sorry.
C: No, that was good.
C: Does Colgate’s general culture promote an idea of sexuality that’s different than how you grew up, I know you mentioned there weren’t hookups in high school.
D: Yeah, absolutely. People only hooked up with someone they were dating, for a while, whether that’s like oral sex or sex sex. So coming here I was like ashamed for having drunk hookups like when I was hooking up with two guys in two nights or two guys in two months like I kind of looked down on it, I was like oh that’s gross and slutty, but it’s definitely changed being on this campus has definitely changed my perception of it. Like its not necessarily something I’m proud of but its not something I’m ashamed of anymore either.
C: And do you think that’s Colgate specific or do you think that’s how a lot of transitions are from high school to college in general?
D: Yeah I think that’s just a transition in general. Like high school is just awkward and weird anyway and like college is still awkward and weird and like I bet you its gonna be a weird transition leaving college and going into the real world too but I don’t want to think about that right now.
C: So you think it’s just kind of college not specifically Colgate?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: Do you think it differs at all from like a small school to a big school?
D: I don’t really know. Most of my friends go to small schools like Colgate so I can’t really compare. I’d imagine it’s a lot less weird because you don’t run into the hookup that you had last night like five times on campus the next day because that happens to me literally every time. So, there’s that difference, but, I think some bigger schools would push even more of a hookup culture because it’s such a random and anonymous thing like you wont see them the next day.
C: Can you describe the social scene at Colgate?
D: Like the drinking scene?
C: Just in general the social scene.
D: My experience has just been going out. (laughs). I mean I have friends that I go out with and I guess I made them in sober contexts, but most of the people I meet now I meet out in a bar or a fraternity, um, so that’s the extent of my social experience. It’s fun, I have a lot of fun drinking, but it inhibits any social interactions when you’re sober. I don’t think people really know how to communicate when they’re sober, um, and people think it’s weird when you hang out with your friends, your guy friends, or your friends of the opposite sex if you’re sober. They think that means that your into them or that you’re dating or something weird and I hate that more than anything.
C: So you think the social scene is mainly focused around drinking?
D: Yes.
C: And are there different- Does everyone participate in the drinking scene or are there certain-
D: I think the Greek community is probably the biggest. I know that there are some people that don’t drink at all on campus and some people that do drink just as much as anyone in a frat or a sorority, but a lot of the people who do go out to drink end up at a frat. Some people do just go straight to bars, but, yeah it think the biggest group on campus would be the Greek life people.
C: And do you think athletics fit into the social scene at all, being a division one school?
D: Not in my experience. I know a lot of people go to  (varsity male sport) parties after a big win or to the (different varsity male sport) frat after a big win for (that varsity male sport). But personally it hasn’t really affected anything, like tailgating isn’t really a big thing. It’s weird cause we have D 1 athletics but a lot of people just don’t give a shit about it. (laughs)
C: Do you think your social experience at Colgate would be different if you were a different race or ethnicity?
D: Yes.
C: How do you think it would be different?
D: I guess I wouldn’t really know until I was put in their shoes, but there’s a huge stigma surrounded by international students and that um without even considering international students, just people of different colors or ethnicities, um, for the most part. That’s a huge generalization and its not true in all aspects but like I think that they have formed different social groups, whether by choice or just by the white majority of people excluding them from social events… which sounds awful.
C: So you’re talking about minorities and international students?
D: Yeah.
C: Okay, and do you think that they, do you see them mixing together or are those groups kept separate?
D: I think those are pretty separate. The international students are very close because they are dealing with um, I mean I’m sure they can relate with each other the best, better than anyone else can, but yeah they’re very separate from other ethnicities on campus.
C: So what do you think their social experience is like?
D: No idea. Sounds really bad, but I’m not really aware of what they do socially. I’m sure some of them go out and drink and maybe I just don’t see it, wow I’m awful, but I think a lot of them, at least from the few that I’ve met, they, um, stay in on the weekends for the most part. They hang out with friends but they don’t go downtown.
C: And what would you say the minority students’ social scene is like?
D: Uh, this is another generalization, but I think they’re a little more comfortable going downtown and to frats cause I guess like they’re used to the American party culture, whereas international students aren’t necessarily used to that, but I still think they’re pretty ostracized from like the typical Colgate: frat, Jug, Bacon, Slices night. I don’t know, maybe I don’t see them as much when I’m out either, but I just don’t notice them when out much.
C: And do you think race ethnicity has an effect on the hookup culture at all?
D: I think so. Not in the sense that I think people are racist and won’t hookup with other people of different ethnicities, at least personally I’m not. But I think it’s because socially they’re more isolate, like the hookup culture is the social culture. So because that group is isolated from the general population at Colgate, there’s not really a chance for those groups to hookup across racial lines.
C: And do you think gender has an effect on the social experience at Colgate?
D: Yeah, a lot. In a lot of ways.
C: Can you give some examples?
D: Well I mean first of all there’s six fraternities on campus um and only three sororities. And like I said, Greek life is a huge part of the social life. That is just obvious that there’s a lot more opportunities for guys to get involved than for girls and fraternities are allowed to host things while sororities aren’t, like host social events while sororities aren’t. That’s another huge thing, like we’re only allowed to be guests at social events, and guys have the control of basically any party that they want to throw.
D: Do you want to put in that I’m a social chair of a sorority?
C:  Yeah, you can say that. You can say whatever you want on here.
D: Yeah so like I didn’t realize, um, how true that is, but like you’d think that like as a social chair that I’d have like a lot of control over what our sorority does socially, but like I don’t really. I like give them dates that are open, and they take them or they cancel on us or they change the theme, change the place, change the date or time, um, so like, I’m not that much of a feminist, but like in that sense, it really pisses me off that girls don’t have more of a say, because when it comes to social life, like without girls guys wouldn’t have any fun when they’re out but like we don’t get to have any influence on like what we’re doing when we’re out, we just have to go to the frats cause that’s just basically all we have.
C: And do you think that gender has an influence on the hookup culture?
D: Yeah. Not, like, I said that Colgate girls and guys, I guess everyone, can like own up to their sexuality, hookup is fine and celebrated. But I’ve seen some things that guys do when they’re out, like hooking up with three different girls within an hour, and then that happens to a girl and that’s just, they get shat on for doing something like that. Guys get to like fist-bump their fraternity brothers and girls are like oh you’re a sloppy slut like you need to go home and like regret your actions. Um, and yeah maybe they probably shouldn’t have done that, but its just a very big double standard that if girls are very aggressive about their sexuality then its like considered slutty, but if guys are then its considered being a bro.
C: And do you find that more prominent or specific to Colgate or just college in general?
D: Colgate’s my main experience with like a hookup culture like this, but like I think its pretty fair to say that’s something in general.
C: And do you think that goes on outside of the drinking culture, or do you think that double is held when alcohol is not involved?
D: No, I think its held when alcohols not involved. Like I said, I don’t have much experience with sober hookup cultures, but I think its just a thing in societies where your drinking or not.
C: And, now just changing a little bit. Growing up, how did your family or friends influence your identity?
D: Oooh such a deep question. Um. I had three older sisters, so ill start with the family, so I clearly had three obvious role models, well role models in the sense that they were the three people that I looked up to most directly. Not necessarily that they were the best people to look up to, but I think that’s how they affected my identity in a way. Like they fucked up a lot, and got in trouble a lot, and like I was the younger sister listening to them get grounded or like get in trouble with my parents so like I saw that happen, so I think that made me a little but more rebellious, and I think it also made my parents much more lenient by the time I got to high school and had to deal with things like that. And when I say fucked up I mean like drinking and drugs and whatever and stuff like that. So I think that was a huge part of me going into high school and college cause like I had seen it happen and I was just like oh my sisters turned out fine so I was much more open and exposed to drinking and hooking up than my friends who didn’t have three older sisters were. And then when it came to friends, they kind of had the opposite affect on me. Like they were, to put it bluntly, kind of prude in high school. Like when I told them I lost my virginity they were like what the heck you’ve only been dating this guy for like six months and I was like EXACTLY, SIX fucking months like. I mean granted I was like two years younger than him but like, I don’t know, we were dating and like I was completely fine with it, but like they were just so shocked and appalled by it that it was just like what the heck I don’t know. So I got conflicting views from my friends and my family I think. My parents didn’t really play a part in it. I don’t fucking talk to my parents about this shit and I never fucking will. They agree, like I think that they know that I’m like mature enough to make my decisions so they respect my uh uh personal space when it comes to that.
C: So you don’t talk to your parents about sex at all?
D: Um, they know that I’m on birth control, now I’m not on birth control. So I talk to them about that. And they know that I’ve had sex and they know more- or they assume more than one person
C: How do they know that you’ve had sex?
D: It’s like an unspoken thing. I was dating this guys for like a year and a half, it was a pretty serious. And they liked him and like and like I went and visited him at college when he was in college and I was in high school. Like they aren’t naïve like they went through this with four girls so like they assumed it. They probably don’t know that like I have sex here more than like, with more than like, like with someone who’s less than my boyfriend. They probably still think that I’m just having sex with someone who means more to me than a random hookup. But they definitely know that I’ve done it. I’m trying to think of what else. This is funny… I was telling my parents about the whole rape situation on campus and how its hard sometimes to figure out if its rape or not cause people just get really really drunk and my dad just flat out asked me do you have drunk sex and I flat out told him like I’m not having this conversation with you and my mom just looked at him like he was crazy so I think he is a little more comfortable at this point talking about things like that, but like we still don’t really, like I also have my friends and my sisters to talk about things like that so I don’t feel like I need to talk to my mom about things like that sex related, God.
C: So your friends and sisters kind of filled that?
D: Yeah, mhm.
C: So are your parents married and living together?
D: Yes, yes.
C: And can you talk a little bit about their marriage 
D: Its really fucking boring. I don’t know. They like, is say boring but I guess that means stable. And like they always say that, like I say how boring their lives are and they like all their kids are gone and they can do whatever they want but they’re always like boring is good, boring means no trouble. But its stupid and I hope I don’t end up like that. Like they’re happily married and like love each other still, but like boring GOD so boring. I mean like their version of an exciting night is like going to the movies with another couple who’s kids have graduated and then like getting a beer. And like maybe that’s what I’ll want when I’m 55 and 56 but I cannot imagine that being what I ever want. And like God I love them but like no not for me.
C: So how long have they been together, or married?
D: They started dating in college. They dated for seven years before they got engaged and I think they’ve been married now for thirty years.
C: So how much older are your sisters?
D: The oldest is 6 years older than me, and then its 4 and then its like a year and a half. So 25, 23, and 21. Yeah, we’re all within 6 years.
C: So they were married when they had all of the kids?
D: Yeah.
C: And now can you talk a little bit more about your relationship experiences? You mentioned you had a boyfriend in high school who was two years older. So how old were you?
D: Um. We started dating-
C: You can make up a name for him too
D: Okay, I started dating Nathan. We were best friends my sophomore year in high school, his senior year. And then we didn’t hook up or start dating or anything until the summer of my going into senior year and his sophomore. No, the summer of me going into my senior year and his sophomore year yeah no that’s right. So we were friends like a long time in high school and then he went away and that was fine and like I wasn’t into it, and this is gonna be such a long story but um. But, he was like really into it when we were  just friends and then clearly when he goes away I like realized oh look I liked him, can’t, whatever. So then we like started dating over the summer and like decided to stay dating when like he went away to college. Like just keep talking about it?
C: Yeah, just however much-
D: I would visit him and he would come home for the breaks and like I didn’t mind the long distance thing cause there was just literally no one else I was interested in my high school in at all so like that was nice.
C: And where did he go to school?
D: Bowdoin. So it was like eight hours for me to visit him, but like I did it like three times his first, the first year that we were dating.
C: And when did you guys breakup?
D: We broke up the spring of my senior year in high school, so I guess we weren’t even dating for a full year. But like, we had been friends for like three years, but like, interesting, I never thought about that. But like yeah we broke up the spring my senior year in high school and it was funny cause like when we got together I was like oh I don’t know why we’re dating, like you’re in college, you should experience college and like not have a girlfriend in high school, like how lame is that. But he wanted to date me and I was like fine I have nothing else to do. And that sounds like very callous of me but that happened. And then by the time I decided where I was going to college and was getting ready to go away, I was like not into having a boyfriend so we broke up when I was still in high school and like still hooked up over the summer but like knew we weren’t staying together.
C: So that was your only boyfriend in high school?
D: Yeah.
C: And have you dated at all here?
D: Nope.
C: Do you think there are a lot of dating couples on campus?
D: No, its, you see a few juniors or seniors dating people but that’s like a rare thing to see I think
C: So how would you define like the term committed relationship?
D: At Colgate?
C: Just in general.
D: Well in general, exclusive so you don’t hookup with other people, you’re seeing them everyday if your like in close like if its not a long distance relationship but like you’re talking to them everyday if it is, what else… you hang out with them a lot. But at Colgate committed relationship kind of equals like for some people, just not hooking up with other people but just hooking up with each other when you’re out. And that’s not like a committed relationship and like some people do soberly hang out and like go on dates and that’s fine but yeah. (laughs). I’m sorry.
C: Have you had a committed relationship even if it wasn’t like dating or anything here?
D: No.
C: So the last thing you would define as a committed relationship would be in-
D: in high school, yes
C: So what are your beliefs toward marriage and how important is that to you?
D: Um, its marriage. I’m not like against marriage and I know I’ll probably end up married but like right now its really hard to imagine someone being like yeah why not let me just say I’ll spend the rest of my life with you, like I don’t understand why you need to say that if you want to. But then I do get that there’s like legal issues like custody over children and property and money blah-blah-blah so like I get marriage in that sense but its just like if you’re gonna be with them forever why don’t you just be with them forever? I don’t know.
C: So just like living with them and stuff like that?
D: Yeah and like in my experience making things official and putting labels on things just scares me off and like its really dumb but it makes it much more serious and more intense and its much more intimidating, so I guess that’s the best word to describe my stance right now, is that I’m intimidated by it but like I’m also not someone who’s gonna say like oh I’m never gonna get married because I know like I probably will and I’m sure I’ll be happy but it just seems very far off and like not very relevant to my life right now.
C: So its not something that you’re like directly thinking about right now?
D: No, not at all.
C: What do you think your parents hopes or opinions are surrounding your future relationships or marriage are?
D: The day I moved into Colgate, my dad turned to me cause like my parents loved the guy I dated, Nathan, they loved Nathan. He was like literally any parents dream come true, like really polite, nice, smart, got into Bowdoin and was running cross-country there, really independent, responsible basically a safe guy… even though he clearly wasn’t like he got me into drinking, drugs, sex like he basically like any bad influence he could have on me he did… but he held up that façade for my parents which was great, but back to the story. So my dad turned to me when he moved me into Colgate and he goes, I think that you should marry Nathan and I was just like WHAT THE FUCK what are you talking about? I think he got really intimidated and realized that I was going away for four years with out their supervision to a party school and like now constantly asking me and all my sisters like why don’t you have a boyfriend, when are you gonna get married? Kind of as a joke but also like slightly concerned that he has four daughters and none of them are even close to being near in a relationship let alone engaged or married. So I think that’s like their next step for them like oh our kids our in college, next they’ll be married and like moving into a house, so I think like they’re ready for that cause like my oldest sisters like 25 so that’s fine, so like her step is there, but like they’re kind of skipping over my step as like being a 19 year old in college and like shoving me in with my sisters. So like yeah there are expectations for that but like that’s just not even relevant to me right now.
C: So like they want you to get married and stuff but you aren’t too concerned about the fact that they want you to get married at this point.
D: Yeah and like when I tell them that’s not something I’m thinking about at this point they’re like oh yeah that’s true like you’re 19 and you’re in college but then other times they’re like oh we just want you to be happy and we don’t want you to be alone- like they equate the two and I’m like, I’d be perfectly, like I like my alone time (laughs). Like I think I would be perfectly fine not getting married. But yeah they want me to get married and have kids.
C: So can you describe your relationship with your parents a little bit? Are you like close with them?
D: Yeah, yeah
C: You said you had sisters you talked about.
D: Yeah, yeah, as much as I can remember like before I went to college like we just like fought all the time or like weren’t that close. Like in middle school or early high school my parents were more concerned with like my older sisters because like they were the ones that like fighting with them and causing problems and then I was home alone my junior and senior year cause all of my sisters were out of the house so I got more attention from them and I think we got closer because I was like the last kid but they also like started fighting with me more. So like we had a stronger relationship, but like that might not necessarily mean we had a better one because we were fighting so much. But now that I’m in college I think that like I’ve matured a lot, like its not that, it wasn’t my parents fault at all, I was being a little whiney bitch in high school and that’s the reason we fought. But now when I come home I feel a lot closer and I feel a lot more comfortable talking to them about drinking and drugs and like they know that I smoke pot sometimes and like they know that I drink all the time, um, I don’t explicitly talk about hooking up with them, but they know it happens, so I think being away and like having my own independence without having to fight against them at home has made us closer if anything. And like the same goes for my sisters, like they went through the same rebellious thing in high school but now they’re much more mature and nicer to my parents as well now that they’re away from them.
C: And, just kind of going back when we were talking a little bit ago about marriage. When you think about relationships in college, do you ever think that a college relationship could lead to marriage.
D: Like I said it doesn’t seem very relevant to my life right now so I don’t think about it that much, but like I do see seniors who are graduating right now and my question is always like oh are you gonna stay together cause like that seems valid like why just break up if you’re really into this person and I realize that I’m asking like oh are you gonna stay together and then like the next question is like what next, like what is in plan for your future?
C: Like if you stay together, what comes next?
D: Yeah, if you stay together then like that means like you see a future beyond college, which means like dating in the real world, getting engaged, and getting married. Like there’s nothing really else that like why else would you stay with them. And like what’s the statistic at Colgate like 30% of people meet their spouse here? I don’t know. So I guess it’s in the back of my mind, but its still really weird for me to think about.
C: So you think, you’ve been talking mostly about juniors and seniors, do you think that’s when most of the like dating and relationships happen?
D: Yeah, I don’t get the point of dating anyone your first year like why? I don’t know. Like for me I guess, I don’t know, that was my time to like do whatever the fuck I wanted and like I feel like if I had dated anyone my freshman year I would regret it now just cause like I was all over the place and like I had fun being on my own freshman year, and sophomore year its like oh a consistent hookup would be nice but like never dating like I wouldn’t have time like I LITERALLY wouldn’t have time for that and like I can’t like going on dates and hanging out and stuff is one thing but like its also like constantly texting someone and like that’s a lot of time and like constantly thinking about someone that also takes a lot of time, it actually does. So like freshman and sophomore year- ehh. But like junior and senior year I can see the appeal cause like you’ve been on campus for four years and like what else are you gonna do unless like you want to keep hooking up, which is fine, like that might happen to me but, um, but yeah to answer your question yeah I think it’s mainly juniors and seniors that are dating.
C: And do you think that’s across all, like men prefer that more or women prefer that more?
D: To stereo-type, I think women would date anyone at any point in their college career, I would say like some of my friends are completely against that and like prove that stereotype wrong, but like I think yeah females are much more open to dating at any point where guys are just like you can’t tie me down.
C: And do you think women thing about marriage at all here?
D: Ahh, I hope not. (laughs) but yeah I think that they do, not in like the crazy, like I don’t want to make them all out to seem like super crazy and like oh I just have to find a husband but I think that like girls here are much more realistic about dating and like what that relationship is where as guys just like cant think further than two weeks.
C: So can you also speak more on your ideas on sexual experience. On a first date, like an actual date,  what do you feel is the most appropriate level of physical contact?
D: I guess it depends on the guy, which like sounds really bad, but like if you’re into it lets, see. So this is like a date? Like you go out to dinner?
C: Yeah. 
D: Hm.
C: Okay well first of all do you think dating happens very often on Colgate’s campus?
D: No, no!
C: So do you think this question is irrelevant or do you think that every once in a while?
D: I mean, its kind of irrelevant but I’ll answer it anyway. I mean some people do go to dinner and watch a movie, rarely, but like, I guess the best description of a date that like I’ve seen happen like A FEW times on Colgate’s campus is like a guy coming over and like watching a movie in bed with a girl. Like that’s a date here. (laughs). So like in that sense?
C: Yeah, in that sense, we’ll do that.
D: So then like you go back to a dorm and you’re laying in bed like watching a movie and like you’re clearly going to hookup at the end of the movie or during the movie, um, so like make out obviously.
C: Is this sober or drunk?
D: Um, if it’s a date I would say sober, so like making out great that’s fine. Like I wouldn’t say have sex at all on a first date, no. Like oral sex? I would say I’m into it so like I would do it if I felt comfortable so like again that’s like is the guy nice? The main like I always draw for like going down on a guy is like um, like if its obvious that that’s all he’s interested in, like for some reason I just have this weird thought in my mind that like that’s all he wants then I’m not gonna give it to him, like I’m very stubborn in that sense, but like if its clear that that’s not all he wants then like ah yeah here’s your reward.
C: What do you mean by that’s all he wants?
D: Like if he like literally just wants to get head and get out of there cause like, I wouldn’t, like its pretty obvious when like that’s all that guys are interested in.
C: So does that go for drunk hookups too or just sober?
D: Well drunk hookups its harder to tall cause you’re drunk but like and I’m much more willing to give oral sex when I’m drunk so I don’t draw the line as much there , but like I still, basically if he’s a douche I’m not gonna to give it to him and if he’s not then I will. And like I kind of tell if he’s a douche or not based on the way he’s acting, like if he’s pushing it too much I get pissed off and like I don’t want to give him a blowjob like I just don’t want to because I’m stubborn and I like saying that its my call to make because it is, I think and whatever. So when he tries taking that decision away from me like I get really mad.
C: What do you mean taking the decision away from you?
D: Like when he says like oh but you have to or and I’m just like what no I don’t HAVE To what are you talking about (laughs) like you cant make me, so like yeah that’s just like how I decide, like how he’s acting and like how important it is to him and just if he’s nice to me or not
C: And you think guys are comfortable saying that?
D: What like saying you have to?
C: Yeah saying that or even just like asking.
D: Yeah, they’re completely comfortable. At least in my experience, and I know some people are like oh he didn’t even make a move so maybe I just pick really aggressive guys or maybe like I act very aggressively about it so they assume that I will. But I have had so many experiences where they are like come on you can’t just leave me like this, and I’m like I can, I wont feel guilty about it or like please, like sometimes when they ask its nicer, but also I’ve also just had people be like this is stupid, you should, and I’m just like no, I shouldn’t like leave me alone.
C: So you think there is like an expectation that guys have about it?
D: Yeah, like in my experience most, like its been a pleasant surprise when guys haven’t been expecting it, but I know that like I’ve talked to a lot of my friends that are like no he didn’t expect it at all, or like he didn’t make any moves towards it at all, so I don’t know if it’s just the way, am I a very aggressive kisser and like body gestures make it seem like I’m about to give him head, I don’t know.
C: And do you think that s a male specific thing, or do you think you, or your friends, or other women are just as likely to be aggressive about receiving oral sex as much as men are?
D: No, like I’ve never ever, like, been like oh you have to. Like I like oral sex, I do, but I’ve never been like you have to go down on me or like you can’t leave me like this, mostly because like they usually just finger me instead and I prefer that much more because its more pleasurable for me.
C: So like that’s a you thing?
D: Yeah and like I don’t think I’ve ever like wanted to be fingered or like eaten out and its not happened, so I don’t know if like I’d have to ask, but I would imagine if I were in a situation where I was giving him head and I wanted something I would be like yo.
C: So you would feel comfortable saying that?
D: Yeah.
C: And do you think most girls would feel comfortable saying that?
D: I guess it depends on how much they hookup. I mean I don’t think I would have been comfortable freshman year here but at this point I’ve hooked up enough and I don’t think guys would think its weird for me to ask them to do something because its like if they’re asking me, I might as well get something out of it too.
C: So do you think that you mentioned before, that men have an expectation that when they go home with someone that they’ll be receiving oral sex. Do you think that women have the same expectation?
D: No, like at least when I go home with someone I rarely am thinking like what I’m gonna get out of it and more like how far he’s gonna push it, cause it is always up to me like where I draw the line, so that’s always the thought process that goes through my mind so yeah no I never really have an expectation for it, I’m just always wondering what his expectations are for it.
C: And do you think that men think if they’re receiving oral sex that they should be giving it, or do you think that’s just not something that crosses their minds?
D: I think most, well not necessarily oral, but like I’ve never had a situation where like I gave someone head and they didn’t like finger me or like eat me out in return.
C: Would you say that’s a typical experience at Colgate?
D: I don’t know. I don’t know. I think for me its typical and its even like and say I’m on my period or like I don’t want it for whatever reason, they ask why not so like they want to kind of like do it, which I wouldn’t expect from a lot of the guys. But like as far as other people at Colgate, I guess I wouldn’t know. A lot of my friends like don’t talk about that or don’t like share those stories.
C: Talk about what?
D: Like if they come home from like hooking up with a guy, wither they don’t go that far because like they don’t feel comfortable going that far or like they feel weird being like, oh he ate me out or like oh I gave him a blowjob.
C: So do you think there’s a difference between being comfortable with saying oh he hate me out or oh I gave him a blowjob? Or do you think people would be equally open about those?
D: Um, I think people are more embarrassed to say oh he ate me out. Yeah cause like in my experience girls are like (squealing voice) eww he did it.. where as they’re just like oh yeah I gave him a blowjob. And like even me I’m just like, well first of all it’s a fucking weird ass phrase to say. Like EW.
C: It is a weird term.
D: Like I don’t think I’m that much of a prude but like that just freaks me out a little bit, but yeah I think there’s definitely a difference when you say it to someone between those two like giving and getting. People are more embarrassed to say that they got it.
C: And do you think that’s men too, like men are more embarrassed to say that they received too?
D: Oh, no
C: Oh, you think it’s gender specific?
D: Oh, yeah, (laughs), absolutely.
C: And do you think that expectations and stuff for oral sex depend on if people are dating or if its just a hookup?
D: Um, yeah, I guess so, so like two people that haven’t done oral sex at all yet like if they’re dating or not? Cause I guess like if they’re dating I’d assume that they already have, but you’re saying in this case that they already have and they’re dating?
C: Just like in general, like not necessarily how the relationship developed but just like two people. Like do you think that if they’re dating do you think that they’re likely to be giving and receiving oral sex like at the same levels?
D: I think they’re more likely because they’re probably more comfortable with each other
C: Do you think there’s a difference in like expectations that a man would have a woman and that a woman would have of a man?
D: Oh in a relationship?
C: Yeah.
D: In my experience, like when I dated Nathan, it was equal, but like he was also a very respectable guy, so like that may have mad a difference, but like if he expected something I expected it back. I don’t know, I think that when you’re dating each other, you both know or should know what each other want so there should be no difference in expectations or asking for it if you want it. But I know that’s not always the case, and in some cases, well most cases girls get embarrassed about it.
C: In relationships or hookups?
D: Relationships.
